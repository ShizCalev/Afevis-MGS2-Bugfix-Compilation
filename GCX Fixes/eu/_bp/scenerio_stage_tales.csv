infiltration of Big Shell was complete. 
As he entered the elevator in the lower 
part of Strut A, he paused to reflect on 
his briefing with Campbell.
Six hours earlier, Big Shell had been 
taken over by a group of heavily armed 
extremists. The terrorists had kidnapped 
the President, who was visiting Big 
Shell on an inspection tour, and taken 
him hostage along with several 
employees of the facility. Now they were 
using the hostages to blackmail the 
government. The terrorists' demands 
were a joke: a list of 20-odd trivialities, 
plus $30 billion in cash.
""Your mission objectives are as follows,"" 
Campbell had said. ""First, infiltrate the 
ocean cleanup facility known as 'Big 
Shell' and rescue the President and the 
other hostages. Second, neutralize the 
terrorists. You are authorized to use 
any means necessary to complete this 
mission. Your contact will be able to fill 
you in with more details later.""
""Contact?""
""One of the President's Secret Service 
agents, a man by the name of Richard 
Ames, seems to have eluded the 
terrorists.""
The name triggered something in 
Snake's brain. He'd heard it before.
""Ames? Isn't he Nastasha's husband?""
""Ex-husband,"" Campbell corrected him. 
""He's also the one who requested our 
help in the first place. But whatever 
means he was using to communicate 
with us has apparently been destroyed, 
and we can't get a hold of him anymore. 
You've got to get in touch with Ames 
directly and find out anything you can 
about the situation inside. His last 
transmission came from Strut F, and he 
should still be hiding somewhere in that 
area. That's where you should head first.""

The elevator began its ascent. As Snake 
took off his diving equipment, he went 
over Campbell's last directive one more 
time in his head. Ames was supposedly 
hiding from these terrorists. Even if 
Snake managed to get close to him, 
Ames wouldn't come out of hiding if 
Snake were being followed. Once he 
arrived at Strut F and started looking 
for Ames, he'd have to be extra careful 
to avoid being detected by the enemy.

Ames nodded. ""And you must be Solid

Learning to read Snake's shrugs, Ames 
took this as a ""yes"".
""I knew they'd send you. After all, 
I asked for the best man they had. That 
was quite an impressive job you pulled 
on that tanker a few years ago.""
""You mean slaughtering those terrorists 
to the last man?"" He felt the painful

scores of fresh, young soldiers lying 
dead in heaps on the deck, the acrid 
smell of blood permeating every corner 
of the ship....
""But you managed to get all the 
hostages out safely, didn't you?"" 
asked Ames.
Snake had heard these words countless 
times. They never helped ease the 
pain. They never would. Snake did not 
feel like explaining that.
""Where is the President?"" he said, 
getting to the point.
Ames looked away.

""...I'm not sure.""
""Are you telling me you don't know 
anything?""
""I've seen the leader of the terrorists.""
""Who? Who is it?""
""Fatman.""
Snake searched his memory. It didn't 
take long for him to trace the name.
Fatman. A disgraced former Navy SEAL 
turned mad bomber. The self-styled 
""Emperor of Explosives."" A man with no 
philosophy or creed. A hardened criminal 
who'd sell himself to anyone for the 
right price. But hadn't he been arrested 
three years earlier after that 
church-bombing incident?
""He was acquitted,"" Ames spat in 
disgust, as if anticipating Snake's 
question.
""Even though more than thirty people 
died in the blast?""
""The jury found him not guilty. They said 
there was still a 'reasonable doubt' as 
to whether he had done it or not. 
Fatman's got a lot of rich and powerful 
friends who can afford to hire the best 
defense attorneys in the business. He 
bought his freedom -- with the same 
blood money he made from killing those 
innocent people!""
Ames' mouth twitched. Maybe he was 
going to grin.
""If he was judged correctly, this would 
not have happened.... In other words, 
the jury's mistake is about to kill us, 
and their President.""
Ames turned around toward Snake.
""Snake, rescue the President. I know 
Fatman was at the heliport. He's 
probably still giving orders there now.""
""The heliport...On the roof of Strut E, 
right?""
As Snake nodded and got up to leave, 
Ames stopped him.
""Don't waste your time trying to take 
him alive. He's got too many tricks up 
his sleeve. And the President's life is 
still in danger.""
Ames took out his USP and looked 
straight into Snake's eyes.
""Promise me you'll kill him.""
He handed the USP to Snake. Then he 
produced a few more objects from his 
jacket.
""Here, you'd better take these along 
with you, too. I picked them up on my 
way here. They should come in handy 
when you're taking care of Fatman.""
Coolant spray, the bomb-detecting

his equipment.

stay here for a while.""

say something. Snake swiftly reached 
out and covered her mouth with his 
hand.

Snake removed her blindfold, keeping 
an eye out for approaching guards. 
Upon seeing Snake's face, Jennifer's 
clear brown eyes glowed with joy. 
But now was not the time to grant her 
wish. Snake said to her,
""I don't mean to disappoint you, but my 
first priority is to rescue the President.

him to a safe place.""
Jennifer's shoulders sagged.
""First, though, I need you to tell me

me, nod your head.""
Jennifer nodded. Snake lifted his hand 
from her mouth.
""What's going on here?""
""Well, when they tied me up and 
dumped me here on the floor, I thought 
I'd never get out alive. Then this guy 
came to rescue me. But he turned out 
to be a cold-blooded jerk, and now I'm 
really mad.""
Snake was at a loss for words. ""I...

""Just kidding. You're looking for the 
President, right? He's already gone,"" 
said Jennifer, almost casually. She 
continued while enjoying Snake's 
puzzled look,
""He escaped through the bottom of one 
of the struts. He should be on a boat 
back to Manhattan right about now. One 
of my fellow agents managed to sneak 
him out as we were being attacked.""
""Are you sure?""
""Yes. Pretty good, aren't I?"" Jennifer 
beamed with pride. ""Too bad we got 
caught before we could see him off....
So, that's that. Maybe it's about time 
for you to save me.""
If the President had escaped safely, 
saving the hostages was the new 
mission. Snake nodded.
""...OK. I've gotta take care of that guard 
first.""
As Snake rose, Jennifer stopped him.
""That's not a good idea.""
""Why not?""
""They supposedly set a bomb in here. 
They said they'd set it off if we tried to 
escape.""
Snake made a small grunt. This wasn't 
going to be that easy.
""Do you know where it is planted?""
""As far as I've been able to tell, it 
should be somewhere here in the Shell

terrorist guards talking to his comrades 
on the radio. It sounded like they were 
going to tighten the security in the 
hostage room. He'd have to get out fast.
""The terrorists don't seem to have any 
intention of harming the hostages. For 
now, at least, sit tight and pretend to be 
captured for a little while longer.""
""Sure. I've got a Level 2 security card

As Snake felt through the jacket for the 
card, Jennifer let out a squeal.

Snake called Campbell by Codec and 
told him what had happened. Campbell 
reported that the President was safe in 
the custody of the Coast Guard. 
Moreover, the SEALs had entered the 
facility while Snake was fighting Fatman 
and were in the process of cleaning up 
the last remaining terrorists.
Yet something about the whole situation 
seemed odd to Snake. ""Fatman said 
that Ames was the one who had 
captured the President. I don't think he 
was lying. But if Ames was involved, 
then why did he ask for my help...?""

Suddenly, Snake heard a woman's 
voice. It was Jennifer. The SEALs had 
rescued her, she said. The other 
hostages were safe as well. But she 
was disappointed that Snake didn't 
come to rescue her personally. She 
asked him if he was happy now that the 
mission was over.
""Yeah, but something's bothering me,"" 
Snake responded. ""Something just... 
doesn't seem right.""
""What doesn't seem right?""
""Fatman said that Ames was in league 
with the terrorists. But he -- ""
Jennifer's eyes widened. ""That's 
impossible! Richard's the one who 
helped the President escape!""
""What are you talking about?""
Something didn't add up. Fatman 
seemed to be telling the truth. But it 
was also true that Ames had cooperated 
with Snake. Now Jennifer was saying 
that Ames had helped the President 
escape. Even if Fatman was lying and 
Jennifer was telling the truth, why would 
Ames neglect to mention that he'd 
already rescued the President?
Snake pondered this riddle in silence. 
Jennifer seemed to take offense at this.
""I don't know what you're thinking, but I 
can assure you that Richard is one of 
our finest agents. There's no way he 
could be working with the terrorists.""
""And why's that?""
""Because he lost his sister in a terrorist 
bombing attack. Three years ago...""
A chill ran down Snake's spine. The 
words came together in a rush. Three 
years ago... terrorist bombing... sister... 
church... Fatman. Snake suddenly 
recalled Ames' strange behavior. The 
way he spat as he said that Fatman had 
been acquitted. His passionate 
conviction that the jury did not bring 
justice to Fatman. The look in his eyes 
as he gave Snake his gun and said, 
""Promise me you'll kill him...""
The pieces were all falling into place 
now. Fatman had killed Ames' sister 
and gotten off scot-free. Ames promised 
revenge. He plotted his revenge. He 
approached the extremist group and 
proposed kidnapping the President. He 
hired Fatman to help carry out the job. 
He led the terrorists. He helped the 
President escape, but didn't bother to 
contact the authorities. Finally, he 
called and asked for Solid Snake, the 
notorious terrorist-killer, to intervene 
personally. Big Shell was the execution 
ground. The President was the bait 
used to lure Fatman to his doom. And 
Snake himself was the executioner.
""Where is Ames?! Have you seen 
him?!""
Jennifer looked startled by Snake's 
sudden change in attitude. ""No. He's 
probably still hiding somewhere. He's 
actually pretty timid, you know. But I'm 
sure he'll come out once he hears that 
the terrorists have all been captured.""

personally. Big Shell was the execution 
ground. The President was the bait 
used to lure Fatman to his doom. And 
Snake himself was the executioner.
""Where is Ames?! Have you seen 
him?!""
Jennifer looked startled by Snake's 
sudden change in attitude. ""No. He's 
probably still hiding somewhere. He's 
actually pretty timid, you know. But I'm 
sure he'll come out once he hears that 
the terrorists have all been captured.""
Snake knew Ames wasn't coming out.
Later, they conducted a search for 
Ames, but there was no trace of him 
anywhere in the country, let alone Big 
Shell. He was gone.#C0

0x4288,"Fatman fell with a sickening thud. 
Snake gazed down at the disgustingly 
fat body. Fatman's chest was moving 
faintly up and down. He'd live.

Snake called Campbell by Codec and 
told him what had happened. Campbell 
reported that the President was safe in 
the custody of the Coast Guard. 
Moreover, the SEALs had entered the 
facility while Snake was fighting 
Fatman and were in the process of 
cleaning up the last remaining terrorists.
|
""Why didn't you kill him?""
Snake turned around to see Ames 
standing behind him.
""Why? I should be asking you the 
same question. Why did you let the 
President go?
""What?""
""Fatman told me everything. You were 
supposed to be guarding the President.""
Ames laughed.
""Fatman? You buy what Fatman said?""
Snake did not move his eyes.
""Yeah, I do. Were you and Fatman a 
team?""
""Never.""
""Is that so?""
Snake advanced toward Ames. Ames' 
hand reached for his chest.
""Wait a minute! You don't know what 
you're talking about! He'd never do 
anything like that!"" Jennifer suddenly 
appeared. The SEALs must have 
rescued her.
""How can you be so sure?"" answered 
Snake, keeping his eyes fixed on Ames.
""Because Richard was the one who 
helped the President escape!""
""What are you talking about?""
Something didn't add up. Fatman didn't 
seem to be lying. But then why had 
Ames cooperated with Snake? 
And now Jennifer was saying that Ames 
had helped the President escape. Even 
if Fatman was lying and Jennifer was 
telling the truth, why would Ames 
neglect to mention that the President 
was safe?
Jennifer continued as Snake pondered 
this riddle. ""Richard is one of our best 
agents. And besides, there's no way 
he'd be involved in a terrorist bombing 
plot in the first place. After all, his 
sister -- ""
""Jennifer!"" Ames interrupted. She 
ignored him.
""Richard lost his younger sister in a 
terrorist bombing attack. Three years 
ago...""
A chill ran down Snake's spine. The 
words came together in a rush. Three 
years ago... terrorist bombing... sister... 
church... Fatman. Snake suddenly 
recalled Ames' strange behavior. The 
way he spat as he said that Fatman 
had been acquitted. His passionate 
conviction that the jury did not bring 
justice to Fatman. The look in his eyes 
as he gave Snake his gun and said, 
""Promise me you'll kill him...""  
A hypothesis was starting to take shape.
Snake looked at Ames. He had no 
facial expression. No panic. No fear. 
Not even anger. The hypothesis had 
now become a conviction.
""Ames, you didn't tell me that you'd 
already rescued the President because 
you thought I'd be less likely to kill 
Fatman for you, right?""
Ames didn't respond. Snake continued.
""Did you call us instead of the police 
because I'd be more likely to kill 
Fatman instead of capturing him alive?""
""That's enough!"" yelled Jennifer. 
Ames' hand inched closer to Snake's 
chest.
""You planned all along to have me kill 
Fatman, didn't you? And all this is 
just -- ""
Ames suddenly pulled a pistol from his 
breast pocket. Snake reacted 
immediately, diving into the shadow of 
a nearby crate. But Ames' gun was 
pointed straight at Fatman's prostrate 
body. He squeezed the trigger.
""Stop!""
Jennifer forced Ames' hand aside, 
knocking the pistol from his grasp. 
It arced through the air and fell with a 
clatter to the ground. Ames made a 
desperate dive for it, but Snake's 
trained reflexes were quicker. He 
reached out and grabbed the gun 
before Ames could get ahold of it. 
Lying sprawled on the ground, Ames 
looked up at Snake, then finally lowered 
his shoulders and relaxed.
Jennifer staggered over to Ames.
""Tell me it isn't so...""
Ames slowly shook his head.
""So... it's true, then?""
Ames sat down wearily and stared up 
at the sky.
""Yes...""
He told his story.

After his sister was killed -- and Fatman 
got off scot-free -- Ames had begun to 
plot his revenge. He approached an 
extremist group with a scheme to 
kidnap the President. Then he hired 
Fatman to carry out the job. It had cost 
him a small fortune just to hire a secret 
agent to track Fatman down and 
convince him to join the conspiracy. 
After that, it was just as Snake had 
described. Ames' plan was to lure 
Fatman to the Big Shell and then have 
Snake kill him... all for the sake of his 
dear, departed sister. Jennifer crouched
down in front of Ames. ""Richard... 
why didn't you tell me...""
""It's a little too heavy for pillow talk, 
wouldn't you agree?""
Jennifer slapped his the face. Tears 
streamed down her cheeks. Ames 
looked away.
""I never meant for you to get involved. 
There weren't supposed to be this 
many hostages. Just the President.""
""No, you don't get it.""
Jennifer took Ames's hand in her own 
and clasped it tightly. She stared 
straight into his eyes with a pleading 
gaze. But he returned no answer. 
""What you did is a crime.""
Drooping her head in silence, Jennifer 
looked as if she were being a bad 
loser. Ames answered.
""I know that. But Fatman must be 
punished.""
""Nothing Fatman did could possibly 
justify what you've done!""
""I know I can't bring my sister back 
from the dead. But put yourself in my 
position for a minute. Do you really 
think you could forgive him? He killed 
my sister, for God's sake! And he 
never spent a single day in prison for it. 
My sister never had a chance to live 
out her life. And yet he sits there 
drinking champagne, fooling around 
with beautiful women, and blowing 
people to bits. Doesn't that strike you 
as horribly wrong?""
""Perhaps... but that doesn't make you 
any less of a criminal."" 
""Sorry, but I just don't see it the same 
way as you.""
Ames reached out with his finger and 
wiped away Jennifer's tears.
""So what are you going to do with me 
now?""
""I'm going to turn you in to the police.""
""I'll probably get life in prison.""
""Yeah, I guess so.""
Ames sighed. ""Before we go, there's 
one last favor I need to ask of you.""
Jennifer looked up at him. ""What?""
""Please, let me kill the bastard.""
Jennifer shook her head sadly. ""I can't 
let you do that.""
""I see... then I guess I'll just have to 
find some other way to do it.""
Ames turned away and muttered to 
himself.
""Lord knows I'll have plenty of time to 
think.""#C0

0x5a8c,"Snake entered the assembly hall. 
There were the hostages -- more than 
twenty of them by the looks of it. 
Terrorist guards patrolled the area, 
checking in every so often by radio. 
If they got even a whiff of anything 
suspicious, the whole place would be 
flooded with reinforcements in no time. 
Once that happened, there'd be nowhere
to run. Snake would somehow have to 
get in touch with Jennifer without being

problem -- how to tell which hostage was
Jennifer? Snake called Campbell on the

Soudain, Snake entendit une voix de
femme.
C'était Jennifer. Les SEALS l'avaient
libérée, dit-elle. Les autres otages étaient
hors de danger. Mais elle était déçue que
Snake ne soit pas venu la sauver
personnellement. Elle lui demanda s'il était
content que la mission soit terminée.
""Oui, mais il y a quelque chose qui me
tracasse,"" répondit Snake. ""Il y a... un hic
quelque part.""
""Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?""
""Fatman a dit qu'Ames était avec les
terroristes. Mais il...""
Jennifer ouvrit grand les yeux. ""Mais c'est
impossible ! Richard a aidé le Président à
s'enfuir !""
""Comment ça ?""
Quelque chose n'allait pas. Fatman semblait
dire la vérité. Mais Ames avait bel et bien
coopéré avec Snake. Et maintenant Jennifer
disait qu'Ames avait aidé le Président à
s'enfuir. Même si Fatman mentait, et que
Jennifer disait la vérité, pourquoi Ames
n'avait-il pas dit qu'il avait déjà sauvé le
Président ?
Snake réfléchissait en silence, ce dont
Jennifer sembla s'offenser.
""Je ne sais pas ce que tu penses, mais je
peux t'assurer que Richard est un de nos
meilleurs agents. Il est impossible qu'il soit
de mèche avec les terroristes.""
""... Et pourquoi ?""
""Parce qu'il a perdu sa sœur dans un
bombardement, il y a trois ans. L'œuvre de
terroristes...""
Snake sentit un frisson le parcourir. Les
mots se bousculaient dans sa tête. Il y a
trois ans... Un bombardement... L'œuvre de
terroristes... Sa sœur... L'église... Fatman. Il
se rappela soudain l'étrange attitude
d'Ames. La façon dont il cracha en disant
que Fatman avait été acquitté. Sa conviction
que le jury n'avait pas rendu justice. Son
regard quand il tendit son revolver en
disant : ""Promets-moi que tu vas le tuer...""
Les morceaux se recollaient. Fatman avait
tué la sœur d'Ames et s'en était tiré à bon
compte. Ames s'était promis de la venger. Il
avait préparé sa vengeance. Il s'était
adressé aux extrémistes et leur avait
proposé de kidnapper le Président. Il avait
demandé à Fatman de les y aider. Il menait
les terroristes. Il avait aidé le Président à
s'enfuir, mais n'avait pas pris la peine de
contacter les autorités. Enfin, il avait
demandé à Solid Snake, le tueur de
terroristes notoire, d'intervenir
personnellement. La Big Shell était son
terrain d'exécution. Le Président était la
proie pour attirer Fatman dans un piège
ultime. Et Snake l'exécuteur.
""Où est Ames !? Tu l'as vu !?""
Jennifer ne comprenait pas le brusque
changement d'attitude de Snake. ""Non. Il se
cache toujours, je suppose. Il est plutôt
timide, tu sais. Mais je suis sûre qu'il sortira
quand il aura appris que tous les terroristes
ont été capturés...""
Il ne sortira pas, pensa Snake.

vain. Il n'était nulle part dans le pays et
nulle part dans la Big Shell. Il était parti.#C0

Jennifer ouvrit grand les yeux. ""Mais c'est
impossible ! Richard a aidé le Président à
s'enfuir !""
""Comment ça ?""
Quelque chose n'allait pas. Fatman semblait
dire la vérité. Mais Ames avait bel et bien
coopéré avec Snake. Et maintenant Jennifer
disait qu'Ames avait aidé le Président à
s'enfuir. Même si Fatman mentait, et que
Jennifer disait la vérité, pourquoi Ames
n'avait-il pas dit qu'il avait déjà sauvé le
Président ?
Snake réfléchissait en silence, ce dont
Jennifer sembla s'offenser.
""Je ne sais pas ce que tu penses, mais je
peux t'assurer que Richard est un de nos
meilleurs agents. Il est impossible qu'il soit
de mèche avec les terroristes.""
""... Et pourquoi ?""
""Parce qu'il a perdu sa sœur dans un
bombardement, il y a trois ans. L'œuvre de
terroristes...""
Snake sentit un frisson le parcourir. Les
mots se bousculaient dans sa tête. Il y a
trois ans... Un bombardement... L'œuvre de
terroristes... Sa sœur... L'église... Fatman. Il
se rappela soudain l'étrange attitude
d'Ames. La façon dont il cracha en disant
que Fatman avait été acquitté. Sa conviction
que le jury n'avait pas rendu justice. Son
regard quand il tendit son revolver en
disant : ""Promets-moi que tu vas le tuer...""
Les morceaux se recollaient. Fatman avait
tué la sœur d'Ames et s'en était tiré à bon
compte. Ames s'était promis de la venger. Il
avait préparé sa vengeance. Il s'était
adressé aux extrémistes et leur avait
proposé de kidnapper le Président. Il avait
demandé à Fatman de les y aider. Il menait
les terroristes. Il avait aidé le Président à
s'enfuir, mais n'avait pas pris la peine de
contacter les autorités. Enfin, il avait
demandé à Solid Snake, le tueur de
terroristes notoire, d'intervenir
personnellement. La Big Shell était son
terrain d'exécution. Le Président était la
proie pour attirer Fatman dans un piège
ultime. Et Snake l'exécuteur.
""Où est Ames !? Tu l'as vu !?""
Jennifer ne comprenait pas le brusque
changement d'attitude de Snake. ""Non. Il se
cache toujours, je suppose. Il est plutôt
timide, tu sais. Mais je suis sûre qu'il sortira
quand il aura appris que tous les terroristes
ont été capturés...""
Il ne sortira pas, pensa Snake.
Plus tard, ils cherchèrent Ames partout, en
vain. Il n'était nulle part dans le pays et
nulle part dans la Big Shell. Il était parti.#C0

""Pourquoi ne l'as-tu pas tué ?""
Snake se retourna. Ames se tenait derrière
lui.
""Pourquoi ? Je devrais te poser la même
question. Pourquoi as-tu laissé le Président
partir ?""
""Quoi ?""
""Fatman m'a tout dit. Tu étais censé
garder le Président.""
Ames éclata de rire.
""Fatman ? Parce que tu crois ce qu'il
dit... ?""
Snake gardait les yeux fixés sur lui.
""Oui... Vous formiez une équipe ?""
""Jamais.""
""Vraiment ?""
Snake s'avança vers Ames. Ames mit la
main à sa poitrine.
""Attends ! Tu ne sais pas de quoi tu parles
! Il ne ferait jamais rien de tel !"" Jennifer
avait surgit de derrière. Les SEALS avaient
dû la libérer.
""Comment peux-tu en être aussi sûre ?""
demanda Snake, tout en fixant Ames.
""Parce que Richard a aidé le Président à
s'enfuir !""
""Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?""
Quelque chose n'allait pas. Fatman semblait
dire la vérité. Mais alors, pourquoi Ames
avait-il coopéré avec Snake ? Et
maintenant Jennifer disait qu'Ames avait
aidé le Président à s'enfuir. Même si
Fatman mentait, et que Jennifer disait la
vérité, pourquoi Ames n'avait-il pas dit que

Jennifer poursuivait tandis que Snake
réfléchissait. ""Richard est un de nos
meilleurs agents. Et d'abord, comment
pourrait-il prendre part à un complot de
terroristes alors que sa sœur...""
Ames la coupa : ""Jennifer !"" Elle ne
l'entendit pas.
""Richard a perdu sa petite sœur dans un
bombardement il y a trois ans. L'œuvre de

Snake sentit un frisson le parcourir. Les
mots se bousculaient dans sa tête. Il y a

que le jury n'avait pas rendu justice. Son

L'hypothèse se formait.
Snake regarda Ames. Son visage était sans
expression. Pas de panique. Pas de peur. Ni
même de la colère. L'hypothèse devint une
conviction...
""Ames, tu ne m'as pas dit que tu avais déjà
sauvé le Président parce que tu avais peur
que je ne tue pas Fatman à ta place,
n'est-ce pas ?""
Ames ne répondit pas. Snake poursuivit.
""Au lieu d'appeler la police, tu nous as
appelés pour que Fatman soit tué et non
pas capturé vivant, n'est-ce pas ?""
""Ça suffit !"" hurla Jennifer. La main d'Ames
se resserrait sur sa poitrine.
""... Depuis le départ, ton plan était de me
faire tuer Fatman, n'est-ce pas ? Et tout ça
pour...""
Soudain, Ames sortit un pistolet de sa
poche. Snake réagit immédiatement et se
cacha dans l'ombre d'un cageot. Mais le
pistolet d'Ames était directement pointé sur
le corps étendu de Fatman. Il appuya sur la
gâchette.
""Arrête !""
Jennifer saisit la main d'Ames et la força à
lâcher le pistolet. Le pistolet partit dans l'air
et retomba sur le sol dans un bruit sec.
Ames tenta de s'en emparer, mais Snake fut
plus rapide. Il avait saisi le pistolet avant
qu'Ames ne puisse le prendre. Etendu sur le
sol, Ames regarda Snake, puis baissa les
épaules et se détendit.
Jennifer avança en titubant vers Ames.
""... Ce n'est pas vrai, dis...""
Ames secoua lentement la tête.
""C'est donc vrai... ?""
Ames s'assit péniblement et regarda le ciel.
""Oui...""
Il raconta tout.
Après la mort de sa sœur et l'acquittement
de Fatman, Ames a préparé sa vengeance.
Il a contacté un groupe d'extrémistes afin de
faire kidnapper le Président. Puis il a
demandé à Fatman de faire le travail.
Engager un agent secret pour retrouver
Fatman et le convaincre de participer à la
conspiration lui avait coûté une petite
fortune. Après, tout s'est passé comme
Snake l'a expliqué. Le plan d'Ames était
d'amener Fatman sur la Big Shell pour que
Snake le tue. Tout cela en souvenir de sa
sœur. Jennifer s'accroupit devant Ames.
""Richard... pourquoi ne m'as-tu rien dit...""
""Ce n'est sans doute pas le moment
d'échanger des secrets, non ?""
Jennifer lui donna une petite tape au visage.
Elle pleurait. Ames détourna son regard.
""Je n'ai jamais voulu t'impliquer. Il ne devait
pas y avoir autant d'otages. Seulement le
Président.""
""Ce n'est pas ce que je veux dire.""
Jennifer prit la main d'Ames dans la sienne
et la serra fort. Elle le regarda droit dans les
yeux d'un air suppliant. Il ne répondit pas.
""Tu as commis un crime.""
Baissant la tête en silence, Jennifer avait
l'air fâché. Ames répondit.
""Je sais. Mais il fallait que Fatman soit
puni.""
""Mais rien de ce que Fatman a fait ne peut
justifier ton crime !""
""Je sais que je ne peux pas ramener ma
sœur à la vie. Mais mets-toi à ma place un
instant. Tu crois vraiment que je peux lui
pardonner ? Il a tué ma sœur, bon sang !
Et il n'a jamais passé un jour en prison pour
autant. Ma sœur a été arrachée à la vie. Et
il est là à boire du champagne, à s'offrir de
belles filles et à mettre les gens en
morceaux. Tu ne trouves pas ça
horriblement injuste ?""
""... Peut-être. Mais ça n'enlève rien au fait
que tu es un criminel."" ""Je regrette, mais je
vois les choses différemment.""
Ames essuya les larmes de Jennifer du
doigt.
""Qu'est-ce que vous allez faire de moi,
maintenant ?""
""Te remettre à la police.""
""Ce sera la prison à perpétuité.""
""... Oui. Je suppose.""
Ames soupira. ""Avant, j'ai un dernier service
à te demander.""
Jennifer le regarda. ""... Lequel ?""
""S'il te plaît, laisse-moi le tuer.""
Jennifer secoua la tête tristement. ""Ça m'est
impossible.""
""Je vois... Il va donc falloir que je songe à
un autre moyen de le faire.""
Ames se détourna en marmonnant.
""Dieu sait que je vais avoir tout le temps de
réfléchir.""#C0

et appuya sur la gâchette. Le premier coup
partit. Le corps de Fatman tressauta et le
sang gicla sur le sol. Un autre coup partit.

continua à tirer coup sur coup, comme mû
par une force invisible. Le son des coups
résonnait sur les toits. Il vida une cartouche,
rechargea et se prépara à tirer encore.
Snake arrêta sa main.
""Il est mort.""
Ames recouvra enfin ses esprits.

Geräusch zu Boden. Eine Blutpfütze bildete
sich unter seinem grotesken Körper. Der
sogenannte ""Sprengstoffkaiser"" hatte
endlich seinen Meister gefunden.
|
Snake rief Campbell über das Codec und
sagte ihm, was geschehen war. Campbell
berichtete, dass der Präsident bei der Coast
Guard in Sicherheit sei. Außerdem hatten
die SEALS die Einrichtung genommen,
während Snake mit Fatman kämpfte und
räumten mit den restlichen Terroristen auf.
Aber irgendetwas störte Snake an der
ganzen Situation. Laut Fatman hatte Ames
den Präsidenten gefangen und er hielt das
für keine Lüge. Wenn dies aber so war,
warum hatte Ames ihn dann um Hilfe
gebeten...?
|
Plötzlich hörte Snake eine weibliche
Stimme.
Es war Jennifer. Die SEALS hätten sie
gerettet, sagte sie. Die anderen Geiseln
seien ebenfalls in Sicherheit. Aber sie war
enttäuscht, dass Snake nicht gekommen
war, um sie persönlich zu retten. Sie fragte
ihn, ob er jetzt froh wäre, da die Mission
beendet sei.
""Ja, aber etwas beunruhigt mich"",
antwortete Snake. ""Da stimmt einfach...
etwas nicht.""
""Was stimmt denn nicht?""
""Laut Fatman war Ames mit den Terroristen
verbündet. Aber er...""
Jennifer riss die Augen auf. Das ist
unmöglich! Richard hat doch dem
Präsidenten zur Flucht verholfen!""
""Wovon reden Sie da nur?""
Da stimmte etwas nicht. Fatman schien die
Wahrheit zu sagen. Aber wahr war auch,
dass Ames mit Snake zusammengearbeitet
hatte. Und jetzt sagte Jennifer, dass Ames
dem Präsidenten zur Flucht verholfen hätte.
Selbst wenn Fatman log und Jennifer die
Wahrheit sagte, warum hatte dann Ames
nicht erwähnt, dass er den Präsidenten
bereits gerettet hatte?
Snake dachte in Ruhe über diese
seltsame Situation nach. Jennifer schien
dies sehr übel zu nehmen.
""Ich weiß nicht, was Sie denken, aber ich
kann Ihnen versichern, dass Richard einer
unserer besten Agenten ist. Es ist
unmöglich, dass er mit den Terroristen
zusammenarbeiten könnte.""
""... Und warum nicht?""
""Weil er seine Schwester bei einem
terroristischen Bombenanschlag verloren
hat. Vor drei Jahren...""
Snake lief es kalt den Rücken runter. Alles
ergab plötzlich einen Sinn. Vor drei Jahren,
Bombenanschlag, Schwester, Kirche,
Fatman. Snake erinnerte sich an Ames
seltsames Verhalten. Wie er den Freispruch
Fatmans entschieden ablehnte. Seine feste
Überzeugung, das Gericht hätte kein
gerechtes Urteil gefällt. Der Augenausdruck
als er Snake die Waffe gab und sagte:
""Versprechen Sie mir, ihn zu töten...""
Jetzt fügte sich das Mosaik zusammen.
Fatman hatte Ames Schwester getötet und
war ungeschoren davongekommen. Ames
wollte sich rächen. Er plante seine
Revanche. Er nahm mit der
Extremistengruppe Verbindung auf und
schlug vor, den Präsidenten in ihre Gewalt
zu bringen. Er heuerte Fatman zur
Ausführung an. Er führte die Terroristen. Er
verhalf dem Präsidenten zur Flucht, meldete
es aber nicht den Behörden. Schließlich bat
er um Hilfe und den persönlichen Einsatz
des bekannten Terroristenkillers Solid
Snake. Big Shell war die Hinrichtungsstätte.
Der Präsident war der Köder, der Fatman in
sein Verhängnis locken sollte. Und Snake
selber war der Scharfrichter.
""Wo ist Ames!? Haben Sie ihn
gesehen!?""
Jennifer war von Snakes plötzlichem

Wahrscheinlich versteckt er sich noch
irgendwo. Er ist übrigens ziemlich ängstlich.
Aber ich bin mir sicher, dass er sein
Versteck verlässt, wenn er hört, dass alle

Snake.
Später wurde nach Ames gesucht. Aber im
ganzen Land war keine Spur von ihm zu
finden, geschweige denn in Big Shell. Er
hatte sich abgesetzt.#C0
","Fatman fiel mit einem entsetzlichen dumpfen
Geräusch zu Boden. Eine Blutpfütze bildete
sich unter seinem grotesken Körper. Der
sogenannte ""Sprengstoffkaiser"" hatte
endlich seinen Meister gefunden.

Snake rief Campbell über das Codec und
sagte ihm, was geschehen war. Campbell
berichtete, dass der Präsident bei der Coast
Guard in Sicherheit sei. Außerdem hatten
die SEALS die Einrichtung genommen,
während Snake mit Fatman kämpfte und
räumten mit den restlichen Terroristen auf.
Aber irgendetwas störte Snake an der
ganzen Situation. Laut Fatman hatte Ames
den Präsidenten gefangen und er hielt das
für keine Lüge. Wenn dies aber so war,
warum hatte Ames ihn dann um Hilfe
gebeten...?
|
Plötzlich hörte Snake eine weibliche
Stimme.
Es war Jennifer. Die SEALS hätten sie
gerettet, sagte sie. Die anderen Geiseln
seien ebenfalls in Sicherheit. Aber sie war
enttäuscht, dass Snake nicht gekommen
war, um sie persönlich zu retten. Sie fragte
ihn, ob er jetzt froh wäre, da die Mission
beendet sei.
""Ja, aber etwas beunruhigt mich"",
antwortete Snake. ""Da stimmt einfach...
etwas nicht.""
""Was stimmt denn nicht?""
""Laut Fatman war Ames mit den Terroristen
verbündet. Aber er...""
Jennifer riss die Augen auf. Das ist
unmöglich! Richard hat doch dem
Präsidenten zur Flucht verholfen!""
""Wovon reden Sie da nur?""
Da stimmte etwas nicht. Fatman schien die
Wahrheit zu sagen. Aber wahr war auch,
dass Ames mit Snake zusammengearbeitet
hatte. Und jetzt sagte Jennifer, dass Ames
dem Präsidenten zur Flucht verholfen hätte.
Selbst wenn Fatman log und Jennifer die
Wahrheit sagte, warum hatte dann Ames
nicht erwähnt, dass er den Präsidenten
bereits gerettet hatte?
Snake dachte in Ruhe über diese
seltsame Situation nach. Jennifer schien
dies sehr übel zu nehmen.
""Ich weiß nicht, was Sie denken, aber ich
kann Ihnen versichern, dass Richard einer
unserer besten Agenten ist. Es ist
unmöglich, dass er mit den Terroristen
zusammenarbeiten könnte.""
""... Und warum nicht?""
""Weil er seine Schwester bei einem
terroristischen Bombenanschlag verloren
hat. Vor drei Jahren...""
Snake lief es kalt den Rücken runter. Alles
ergab plötzlich einen Sinn. Vor drei Jahren,
Bombenanschlag, Schwester, Kirche,
Fatman. Snake erinnerte sich an Ames
seltsames Verhalten. Wie er den Freispruch
Fatmans entschieden ablehnte. Seine feste
Überzeugung, das Gericht hätte kein
gerechtes Urteil gefällt. Der Augenausdruck
als er Snake die Waffe gab und sagte:
""Versprechen Sie mir, ihn zu töten...""
Jetzt fügte sich das Mosaik zusammen.
Fatman hatte Ames Schwester getötet und
war ungeschoren davongekommen. Ames
wollte sich rächen. Er plante seine
Revanche. Er nahm mit der
Extremistengruppe Verbindung auf und
schlug vor, den Präsidenten in ihre Gewalt
zu bringen. Er heuerte Fatman zur
Ausführung an. Er führte die Terroristen. Er
verhalf dem Präsidenten zur Flucht, meldete
es aber nicht den Behörden. Schließlich bat
er um Hilfe und den persönlichen Einsatz
des bekannten Terroristenkillers Solid
Snake. Big Shell war die Hinrichtungsstätte.
Der Präsident war der Köder, der Fatman in
sein Verhängnis locken sollte. Und Snake
selber war der Scharfrichter.
""Wo ist Ames!? Haben Sie ihn
gesehen!?""
Jennifer war von Snakes plötzlichem
Haltungswechsel überrascht. ""Nein.
Wahrscheinlich versteckt er sich noch
irgendwo. Er ist übrigens ziemlich ängstlich.
Aber ich bin mir sicher, dass er sein
Versteck verlässt, wenn er hört, dass alle
Terroristen gefangen wurden...""

Snake.

berichtete, dass der Präsident bei der Coast

räumten mit den restlichen Terroristen 
auf.
|
""Warum haben Sie ihn nicht getötet?""
Snake drehte sich um und sah Ames, der
hinter im stand.
""Warum? Die Frage müsste ich Ihnen
stellen. Warum haben Sie den Präsident
entkommen lassen?
""Wie?""
""Fatman hat mir alles erzählt. Sie sollten
den Präsidenten bewachen.""
Ames lachte.
""Fatman? Sie nehmen Fatman das ab...""
Snake wendete den Blick nicht ab.
""Ja, tatsächlich... Waren Sie und Fatman
ein Team?""
""Niemals.""
""Ist das wahr?""
Snake ging auf Ames zu. Ames griff zur
Brusttasche.
""Warten Sie! Sie wissen ja nicht, wovon
Sie da reden! So etwas würde er nie tun!""
Jennifer tauchte plötzlich von hinten auf. Die
SEALS mussten sie befreit haben.
""Wie können Sie da so sicher sein?"",
fragte Snake und behielt dabei Ames weiter
im Blick.
""Weil Richard dem Präsidenten zur Flucht
verholfen hat!""
""Wovon reden Sie da nur?""
Da passte etwas nicht zusammen. Fatman
schien nicht zu lügen. Aber warum hatte
Ames dann mit Snake
zusammengearbeitet? Und jetzt sagte
Jennifer, dass Ames dem Präsidenten zur
Flucht verholfen hatte. Selbst wenn Fatman
gelogen hatte und das, was Jennifer sagte,
stimmte, stand die Frage, warum Ames
nicht erwähnt hatte, dass der Präsident in
Sicherheit war.
Jennifer sprach weiter, während Snake über
dieses Rätsel nachdachte. ""Richard ist einer
unserer besten Agenten. Und außerdem ist
es unmöglich, dass er in einen
terroristischen Bombenanschlag verwickelt
sein könnte. Schließlich ist seine Schwester
ja...""
""Jennifer!"", unterbrach sie Ames. Aber
sie beachtete ihn nicht.
""Richard hat seine jüngere Schwester bei
einem terroristischen Bombenanschlag
verloren. Vor drei Jahren...""
Snake lief es kalt den Rücken runter. Alles
ergab plötzlich einen Sinn. Vor drei Jahren,

""Versprechen Sie mir, ihn zu töten..."" Das
war eine Hypothese.
Snake sah Ames an. In seinem Gesicht
regte sich nichts. Keine Panik. Keine Angst.
Nicht einmal Ärger. Damit hatte sich die
Hypothese bestätigt.
""Ames, Sie haben mir nicht gesagt, dass
Sie den Präsidenten bereits gerettet hatten,
weil Sie annahmen, dass ich ansonsten
Fatman mit geringerer Wahrscheinlichkeit
für Sie getötet hätte, nicht wahr?""
Ames antwortete nicht. Snake sprach weiter.
""Haben Sie uns gerufen, anstatt die Polizei
zu verständigen, weil es wahrscheinlicher
war, dass ich Fatman töte statt ihn lebend
zu fangen?""
""Das reicht!"", schrie Jennifer. Ames schob
die Hand näher zur Brusttasche.
""... Sie planten die ganze Zeit, Fatman
durch mich töten zu lassen, nicht wahr?
Und das alles ist...""
Ames zog plötzlich eine Pistole aus der
Brusttasche. Snake reagierte sofort und
warf sich hinter eine in der Nähe stehende
Kiste. Doch Ames zielte auf den am Boden
liegenden Körper von Fatman. Er drückte
den Abzug.
""Halt!""
Jennifer zog Ames Hand zur Seite, so dass
er die Pistole losließ. Sie flog in einem
Bogen und schlug polternd am Boden auf.
Ames ließ sich sofort fallen, um sie zu
packen, aber Snake mit seinen trainierten 
Reflexen war schneller. Er streckte sich und
fasste die Pistole, bevor Ames sie hatte.
Ames lag ausgestreckt am Boden und sah
zu Snake hoch. Dann gab er schließlich auf.
Jennifer ging schweren Schrittes zu Ames.
""... Sag, dass es nicht wahr ist...""
Ames schüttelte langsam den Kopf.
""Dann... stimmt es also?""
Ames setzte sich müde hin und starrte in
den Himmel.
""Ja...""
Er erzählte seine Geschichte.
Nachdem Ames Schwester ermordet und
Fatman dafür nicht belangt wurde, schwor er
Rache. Er kontaktierte eine
Extremistengruppe und schlug die
Entführung des Präsidenten vor. Dann
heuerte er Fatman zur Ausführung an. Es
kostete ihn ein kleines Vermögen, über
einen Geheimagenten Fatman zu finden und
ihn dann zu überzeugen, bei der
Verschwörung mitzumachen. Danach verlief
alles so, wie Snake annahm. Ames plante,
Fatman zu Big Shell zu locken und ihn von
Snake töten zu lassen. Alles seiner lieben,
toten Schwester wegen.
Jennifer hockte sich vor Ames hin.
""Richard... warum hast du mir denn nicht
gesagt...""
""Ein bisschen zu ernst für Bettgeflüster,
meinst du nicht auch?""
Jennifer gab ihm eine Ohrfeige. Tränen
liefen ihr über die Wangen. Ames wendete
den Blick ab.
""Ich wollte nie, dass du da reingerätst. So
viele Geiseln waren nicht vorgesehen. Nur
der Präsident.""
""Nein, du verstehst es nicht.""
Jennifer nahm Ames Hand und drückte sie
fest. Mit flehendem Blick sah sie ihm in die
Augen. Aber er antwortete nicht.
""Das war ein Verbrechen.""
Still ließ Jennifer den Kopf sinken und sah
wie eine schlechte Verliererin aus. Ames
antwortete.
""Ich weiß. Aber Fatman musste bestraft
werden.""
""Was auch immer Fatman tat, es konnte
nicht rechtfertigen, was du getan hast!""
""Ich weiß, dass ich meine Schwester nicht
wieder lebendig machen kann. Aber
versetze dich nur eine Minute in meine
Lage. Glaubst du, dass du ihm wirklich
vergeben könntest? Er hat, um Gottes
willen, meine Schwester getötet! Und er hat
nicht einen Tag im Gefängnis dafür gebüßt.
Meine Schwester hatte keine Chance für ein
erfülltes Leben. Aber er sitzt da, trinkt Sekt,
spielt mit schönen Frauen herum und
sprengt Menschen in die Luft. Findest du
das nicht schrecklich ungerecht?""
""... Mag sein. Aber das schmälert dein
Verbrechen nicht.""
""Tut mir leid, aber ich sehe das eben
anders als du.""
Ames wischte Jennifers Tränen mit dem
Finger weg.
""Was wirst du jetzt mit mir machen?""
""Ich werde dich der Polizei übergeben.""
""Wahrscheinlich bekomme ich
lebenslänglich.""
""... Ja, das wird wohl so sein.""
Ames seufzte. ""Bevor wir gehen, möchte ich
dich um einen letzten Gefallen bitten.""
Jennifer blickte hoch. ""Was denn?""
""Bitte lass mich den Schweinehund töten.""
Jennifer schüttelte traurig den Kopf. ""Das
kann ich nicht zulassen.""
""Aha... dann werde ich wohl einen anderen
Weg finden müssen.""
Ames wendete sich ab und murmelte vor
sich hin.
""Ich habe weiß Gott viel Zeit zum
Nachdenken.""#C0

chiese se era contento, ora che la missione

collaborato con Snake. E ora Jennifer stava

Presidente a fuggire. Anche se Fatman
avesse mentito e se Jennifer avesse detto
la verità, allora perché Ames non gli aveva
detto di avere già salvato il Presidente?

enigma. Jennifer sembrò seccata per
questo.

""... E perché mai?""
""Perché ha perso sua sorella in un
attentato terroristico, tre anni fa...""
A Snake vennero i brividi. Si ricordò tutte le
sue parole. Tre anni fa - un attentato
terroristico - la sorella - la chiesa - Fatman.
Snake ricordò lo strano comportamento di
Ames, che aveva sputato mentre diceva che
Fatman era stato assolto. Si era infervorato
nella convinzione che la giuria avesse
sbagliato con Fatman. Lo sguardo che
aveva lanciato a Snake quando gli aveva
dato l'arma dicendogli ""Promettimi che lo
ucciderai...""
Ora tutti i conti tornavano. Fatman aveva
ucciso la sorella di Ames e l'aveva fatta
franca. Ames promise e pianificò la sua
vendetta. Avvicinatosi al gruppo di estremisti
proponendogli il rapimento del Presidente,
aveva assoldato Fatman per fare il lavoro,
mentre lui dirigeva i terroristi. Poi aiutò il
Presidente a fuggire, senza pensare di
contattare le autorità. Infine aveva richiesto
l'intervento personale di Solid Snake, il
famoso killer di terroristi. La Big Shell era
stato il teatro dell'esecuzione. Il Presidente
aveva fatto da esca per attirare Fatman
nella trappola mortale. E Snake in persona
ne era stato il boia.
""Dove sta Ames?! Lo hai visto?!""
Jennifer sembrava spaventata dal repentino
cambiamento d'umore di Snake. ""No, starà
ancora nascosto da qualche parte. Sai, è un
po' fifone. Ma sono sicuro che uscirà allo
scoperto quando sentirà che sono stati
catturati tutti i terroristi...""
Ma Snake pensava che non sarebbe uscito
fuori.
Successivamente andarono alla ricerca di
Ames, ma non c'era traccia di lui nel Paese,
tantomeno sulla Big Shell. Era sparito.#C0
","Fatman cadde al suolo con un tonfo
rivoltante e sotto il suo corpo grottesco si
allargò una pozza di sangue. Il famigerato
""Re degli Esplosivi"" era ormai giunto al
capolinea.
|
Snake chiamò Campbell con il Codec e gli
disse cos'era successo. Campbell gli
comunicò che il Presidente era al sicuro, in
custodia della Guardia Costiera. Inoltre,
mentre Snake affrontava Fatman, i SEAL
della Marina erano entrati nell'impianto e si
stavano occupando degli ultimi terroristi
rimasti.
Eppure c'era qualcosa che a Snake non
quadrava: Fatman aveva detto che era stato
Ames a catturare il Presidente. Non
sembrava che stesse mentendo. Ma in quel
caso, perché mai Ames gli aveva chiesto
aiuto...?
|
Improvvisamente, Snake sentì una voce di
donna.
Era Jennifer. Disse che i SEAL l'avevano
salvata. Anche gli altri ostaggi erano al
sicuro. Ma era dispiaciuta che non fosse
stato Snake in persona a salvarla e gli
chiese se era contento, ora che la missione
era stata compiuta.
""Già, ma c'è qualcosa che mi preoccupa,""
replicò Snake. ""Qualcosa... non mi quadra
affatto.""
""Cos'è che non ti quadra?""
""Fatman ha detto che Ames era in
combutta con i terroristi. Ma lui...""
Jennifer spalancò gli occhi. ""È impossibile!
È stato Richard ad aiutare il Presidente a
fuggire!""
""Ma di cosa parli?""
I conti non tornavano: Fatman era sembrato
sincero, ma era anche vero che Ames aveva
collaborato con Snake. E ora Jennifer stava
dicendo che Ames aveva aiutato il
Presidente a fuggire. Anche se Fatman
avesse mentito e se Jennifer avesse detto
la verità, allora perché Ames non gli aveva
detto di avere già salvato il Presidente?
Snake rifletteva in silenzio su questo
enigma. Jennifer sembrò seccata per
questo.
""Non so a cosa stai pensando, ma ti
assicuro che Richard è uno dei nostri
migliori agenti. È escluso che stesse
collaborando con i terroristi.""

Snake si voltò e vide Ames alle sue spalle.
""Perché? Io ti dovrei fare la stessa
domanda: perché hai lasciato andare il
Presidente?""
""Cosa?""
""Fatman mi ha detto tutto. Tu dovevi fare la
guardia al Presidente.""
Ames si mise a ridere.
""Fatman? E tu credi a quello che dice
Fatman?""
Snake non batté ciglio.
""Certo... Tu eri d'accordo con Fatman?""
""Mai.""
""Ah davvero?""
Snake avanzò verso Ames, che stese una
mano per fermarlo.
""Aspetta un minuto! Ti rendi conto di cosa

disse Jennifer, che era sbucata
all'improvviso. Doveva essere stata liberata
dai SEAL.

Snake guardò Ames. Dal suo volto non
trapelava alcuna espressione: niente panico,
né paura e nemmeno rabbia. L'ipotesi era
stata convalidata.
""Ames, il motivo per cui non mi hai detto
che avevi già salvato il Presidente è che
pensavi che se lo avessi fatto, forse non
avrei ammazzato Fatman per conto tuo, o
sbaglio?""
Ames non rispose. Snake continuò.
""Hai chiamato noi invece della polizia
perché era più probabile che io avrei ucciso
Fatman invece di prenderlo vivo?""
""Ora basta!"" gridò Jennifer. Ames avvicinò
ancora di più la mano al petto.
""Fin dall'inizio avevi in mente di farmi
uccidere Fatman, non è così? Tutto questo
è...""
Improvvisamente Ames tirò fuori una pistola
dal taschino. Snake reagì immediatamente,
lanciandosi dietro una cassa vicina. Ma
Ames aveva puntato l'arma contro Fatman,
che giaceva bocconi. Strinse il grilletto.
""Fermo!""
Jennifer spinse la mano di Ames a lato,
facendogli mollare la presa. La pistola
volteggiò in aria e cadde rumorosamente al
suolo. Ames si tuffò come un disperato per
acciuffarla, ma con i suoi riflessi pronti,
Snake si allungò e afferrò la pistola prima
che lo facesse Ames. Disteso a terra, Ames
alzò lo sguardo verso Snake; alla fine
abbassò le spalle e si calmò.
Jennifer avanzò barcollando verso Ames.
""... Dimmi che non è vero...""
Ames scosse la testa lentamente.
""Ma allora è vero...?""
Ames si sedette, stanco, e guardò verso il
cielo.
""Sì...""
Poi raccontò la sua storia.
Dopo che la sorella era stata uccisa - e
Fatman l'aveva fatta franca - Ames aveva
iniziato a ordire la vendetta. Avvicinatosi a
un gruppo di estremisti con un piano per
rapire il Presidente, aveva assoldato Fatman
per fare il lavoro. Gli era costato una piccola
fortuna l'agente segreto ingaggiato per
scovare Fatman e convincerlo a partecipare.
Il resto era come l'aveva descritto Snake.
Ames voleva attirare Fatman nella Big Shell
e poi farlo uccidere da Snake. Tutto per la
sua cara, defunta sorella.
Jennifer si accovacciò davanti ad Ames.
""Richard... perché non me l'hai detto...""
""Non è facile condividere una cosa del
genere, non credi?""
Jennifer gli mollò un ceffone, poi iniziò a
piangere. Ames distolse lo sguardo da lei.
""Non avrei mai voluto coinvolgerti. Non
dovevano esserci tutti quegli ostaggi, ma
solo il Presidente.""
""No, non capisci.""
Jennifer prese la mano di Ames e la strinse
nella sua, fissandolo negli occhi con
un'espressione supplichevole. Ma lui non
disse niente.
""Ciò che hai fatto è un crimine.""
Abbassata la testa in silenzio, Jennifer
sembrava aver perso ogni speranza. Ames
le rispose.
""Lo so. Ma Fatman deve essere punito.""
""Ma niente di ciò che ha fatto Fatman può
giustificare ciò che hai fatto tu!""
""Lo so che non posso riportare in vita mia
sorella. Ma mettiti nei miei panni per un
minuto. Pensi davvero che l'avresti
perdonato? Ha ucciso mia sorella, perdio!
E non ha passato neanche un giorno in
prigione per questo. Mia sorella non ha mai
avuto la possibilità di farsi una vita. E lui se
ne sta a bere champagne, a divertirsi con le
belle donne e a far saltare in aria la gente.
Non ti pare tremendamente ingiusto?""
""... Forse. Ma tu sei diventato un criminale
come lui.""
""Scusa, ma io non la penso come la pensi
tu.""
Ames allungò il dito per asciugare le lacrime
di Jennifer.
""E adesso cos'hai intenzione di fare con
me?""
""Devo consegnarti alla polizia.""
""Probabilmente mi daranno l'ergastolo.""
""... Già, penso di sì.""
Ames sospirò. ""Prima di andare, ti devo
chiedere un ultimo favore.""
Jennifer alzò lo sguardo verso di lui.
""Cosa?""
""Ti prego, lasciami uccidere quel bastardo.""
Jennifer scosse la testa, con amarezza.
""Non posso fartelo fare.""
""Ho capito... allora dovrò trovarmi un altro
modo per farlo.""
Ames girò la testa, mormorando fra sé e sé.

comunicó que el Presidente se encontraba
sano y salvo bajo la custodia del Guardia

habían entrado a la planta mientras Snake
estaba luchando contra Fatman y estaban
liquidando al resto de los terroristas.
Pero había algo que no cuadraba. Fatman le
había dicho que Ames fue la persona que
secuestró al Presidente. No creo que él
estuviera mintiendo. Y si fuera así, entonces
¿por qué Ames le pidió ayuda...?

De repente, Snake escuchó la voz de una
mujer.
Era Jennifer. Los SEALS la habían
rescatado, dijo ella. El resto de los rehenes
también estaban a salvo. Pero estaba
decepcionada porque Snake no la había
rescatado personalmente. Le preguntó si
estaba contento ahora que la misión ya se
había terminado. ""Sí, pero hay algo que
todavía me tiene algo intrigado,"" respondió
Snake. ""Hay algo... que no cuadra.""
""¿Qué es lo que no cuadra?""
""Fatman dijo que Ames estaba trabajando
con los terroristas. Pero él...""
Jennifer abrió los ojos como platos. ""¡Eso
es imposible! Si fue Richard quien ayudó a
escapar al Presidente.""
""¿De qué estás hablando?""
Estaba ocurriendo algo raro. Creo que
Fatman estaba diciendo la verdad. Pero
también era verdad que Ames cooperó con
Snake. Y ahora Jennifer estaba diciendo
que Ames fue quien ayudó a rescatar al
Presidente. E incluso si Fatman estaba
mintiendo, si lo que Jennifer decía era
verdad, ¿por qué Ames no le había dicho
que ya había rescatado al Presidente?
Snake reflexionaba sobre todo esto para
sus adentros. A Jennifer no le gustaba que
él no compartiera sus inquietudes con ella.
""No sé lo que estás pensando, pero te
puedo asegurar de que Richard es uno de
nuestros mejores agentes. Es imposible que
estuviera trabajando con los terroristas.""
""¿.. Y por qué es imposible?""
""Porque su hermana murió en un incidente
terrorista, víctima de una bomba. Hace tres
años...""
Un escalofrío recorrió la espina dorsal de
Snake. Las palabras iban encajando una a
una. Hace tres años... una bomba
terrorista... hermana... iglesia... Fatman.
Snake recordó repentinamente el extraño
comportamiento de Ames. Su rabia al hablar
sobre la absolución de Fatman. Y su
convencimiento al hablar sobre el fallo
del jurado. La expresión de sus ojos cuando
le dio la pistola a Snake y le dijo,
""Prométeme que le matarás...""
Ahora las cosas iban cobrando sentido.
Fatman mató a la hermana de Ames y no
pagó por su delito. Ames prometió
vengarse. Planeó cautelosamente su
venganza. Se acercó al grupo extremista y
les propuso secuestrar al Presidente.
Contrató a Fatman para que realizara el
trabajo. Dirigió a los terroristas. Ayudó al
Presidente a escapar, pero no se lo
comunicó a las autoridades. Finalmente,
pidió la ayuda de Solid Snake, el célebre
antiterrorista, para que interviniera
personalmente. El Big Shell era el lugar en
el que acontecía su plan. Y el Presidente
era el cebo para que Fatman picara. Y
Snake, él mismo, sería el verdugo.
""¡¿Dónde está Ames?! ¡¿Le has visto?!""
Jennifer parecía sorprendida por el cambio
de actitud de Snake. ""No. Pero
probablemente todavía sigue escondido en
algún lugar. En realidad es muy tímido y
miedoso, ¿sabes? Pero estoy segura de
que saldrá de su escondite cuando sepa
que los terroristas han sido capturados...""
No va a salir, pensó Snake para sus
adentros.
Más tarde, buscó a Ames, pero no había
ningún rastro de él en todo el país, como
para encontrarle en el Big Shell. Había
desaparecido.#C0

Snake miró a Ames. Su cara no mostraba

siquiera rabia. La hipótesis pasaba a ser
una realidad...
""Ames, no me dijiste que el Presidente ya
había sido rescatado porque pensabas que
si lo hacías, sería menos probable que yo
matara a Fatman, ¿no?""
Ames no contestó. Snake continuó.
""¿Nos llamaste a nosotros en vez de llamar

probable que nosotros matáramos a Fatman
en vez de capturarle vivo?""
""¡Ya es suficiente!"" gritó Jennifer. Ames se
acercó su mano todavía más a su pecho.
""... Tu plan, en todo momento, era que yo
matara a Fatman, ¿no? Y todo esto era

Ames sacó de pronto una pistola del bolsillo
de su chaqueta. Snake reaccionó
inmediatamente, y se escondió detrás de
una caja que había cerca. Pero Ames
estaba apuntando directamente al cuerpo
postrado de Fatman. Apretó el gatillo.
""¡Para!""
Jennifer le dio un golpe en la mano a Ames
y éste perdió el control de la pistola. Salió
disparada por el aire y cayó
estrepitosamente al suelo. Ames se lanzó a
por la pistola pero Snake fue más rápido
que él. Se estiró y cogió la pistola antes de
que Ames pudiera hacerlo. Tumbado en el
suelo, Ames miró hacia arriba, a Snake, y
finalmente relajó sus hombros.
Jennifer fue tambaleándose hacia Ames.
""... Dime que no es verdad...""
Ames asintió con la cabeza muy despacio.
""Así que... ¿es verdad?""
Ames se sentó y miró hacia el cielo.
""Sí...""
Les contó toda la historia.
Tras la muerte de su hermana, y la
absolución de Fatman, Ames comenzó a
trazar un plan para vengarse. Se acercó al
grupo extremista y les propuso secuestrar al
Presidente. Contrató a Fatman para que
realizara el trabajo. Le había costado una
pequeña fortuna el mero hecho de contratar
a un agente secreto para que localizara a
Fatman y para que le convenciera de que
se uniera al grupo. Tal y como Snake se lo
había imaginado. Según el plan de Ames,
Fatman tenía que estar en el Big Shell y
Snake tenía que asesinarlo. Y todo para
vengar la muerte de su querida hermana.
Jennifer se agachó para estar al lado de
Ames. ""Richard... por qué no me lo
dijiste...""
""Es una historia demasiado fuerte como
para contarla en la cama, ¿no te parece?""
Jennifer le soltó una bofetada. Las lágrimas
le corrían por la cara. Ames miró hacia otro
lado.
""No quería que tú estuvieras involucrada en
esto. No debería de haber habido tantos
rehenes. Sólo el Presidente.""
""No, no lo entiendes.""
Jennifer tomó entre sus manos la mano de
Ames y la apretó con fuerza. Le miró
fijamente a los ojos con una mirada
suplicante. Pero él no contestó.
""Lo que has hecho es un crimen.""
Dejó caer su cabeza en silencio, Jennifer no
parecía ser una buena perdedora.
Ames contestó.
""Lo sé. Pero Fatman tenía que ser
castigado.""
""¡Nada de lo que Fatman haya hecho puede
justificar tus actos!""
""Sé que no puedo resucitar a mi hermana.
Pero ponte en mi lugar por un minuto. ¿Le
habrías perdonado? ¡Mató a mi hermana,
por amor de Dios! Y no pasó ni siquiera un
día en la cárcel. No... que va, todo el día
bebiendo champan, rodeado de mujeres
hermosas y asesinando a gente inocente.
¿No te parece algo horrible?""
""...Sí. Pero eso no justifica lo que has
hecho y no te hace menos culpable.""
""Lo siento, pero no comparto tu opinión.""
Ames alargó su mano y secó las lágrimas
de Jennifer.
""¿Y qué vas a hacer ahora conmigo?""
""Te voy a entregar a la policía.""
""Me condenarán a cadena perpetua.""
""Sí, me temo que sí.""
Ames suspiró. ""Antes de irnos, tengo que
pedirte un favor.""
Jennifer le miró. ""¿Qué...?""
Por favor, déjame que mate a este
bastardo.""
Jennifer negó con la cabeza. ""No puedo
dejar que hagas eso.""
""Ya veo... voy a tener que buscar otra
forma de hacerlo.""

began to relate his story. He'd recently 
discovered the whereabouts of his 
long-estranged stepsister. Apparently, 
she was working as a systems 
programmer at an ocean cleanup facility 
in Manhattan Bay called ""Big Shell.""
""Wait a minute. Big Shell... isn't that
where...?""
""Exactly. So you've heard the rumors,

There had recently been a string of 
accidental deaths among the employees 
of Big Shell. A number of rumors were 
circulating about the cause of these 
deaths - there was a serial killer on the 
loose, the employees were going 
stir-crazy, the whole place was haunted. 
Big Shell had gone from being a 
symbol of environmental responsibility 
to being a lucrative source of tabloid 
gossip.
""I'm worried about Emma. Will you go

Snake waved his hand in dismissal.

""No, that belongs to the Marines.

guard down.

him square in the eye. ""What's -- your

""People in my line of work don't need

A slight frown crossed Emma's face. 
""...Hmph. You might not be a bad guy, 
but you sure are weird. But whatever.

""Call me Snake."" Snake sighed. Talking 
to this kid was making him tired.
""Man, you're really uptight about names,

Snake interrupted her. ""Let me ask you

""...Sure, fine.""
""Why are those terrorists looking for

Snake couldn't think of anything to say 
to this. Emma seemed a little 
disappointed.
""...Or maybe it's because I changed the 
password for the computer system and 
locked them out.""
""What do you mean?""
Emma explained. She'd seen the 
terrorists trying to use Big Shell's 
computer system to do something. 
Then, after creating a diversion and 
making her escape, she'd made a 
change to the system so that they 
couldn't use it anymore. ""It bought me 
some time, and I thought it might irritate 
them as an added bonus, too.""
She was probably more concerned with 
the latter, Snake thought to himself. 
""So what are the terrorists trying to do 
with the system?""
""How should I know?""
""Does it have something to do with the 
'ghost of Big Shell'?""
""What are you talking about?"" Emma 
feigned a look of surprise.
""They said that some of their comrades 
got killed by the 'ghost of Big Shell.' 
So who is this 'ghost' they're talking 
about, anyway?""
Emma glared at Snake in disgust.
""Why are you looking at me like that?""
""The 'ghost of Big Shell'? That's so 
lame!"" She waved her hands above her 
head. ""Sure, it's true that three of them 
have died in the last month. It was 
actually really sad. Two of them just up 
and disappeared one after another. 
Then this other guy who'd just got here, 
he disappeared, too.... But they were all 
accidents, okay? They're just 
connecting it with some stupid, childish 
legend....""
""'Legend'? So this 'ghost' story has 
been around for a while?""
""Yeah. They say that there was this one 
employee a long time ago whose son 
died, and he tried to kill himself, but he 
didn't really die, he just got really 
mangled and stuff, and now he haunts 
the place.... You know, that sort of 
thing.""
Something in Emma's eyes seemed to 
flicker for a moment, but she quickly 
recovered. Her voice became cheerful 
again.
""Hey, these kinds of places always have 
one or two ghost stories associated with 
them, right?... Some people say they've 
seen shadows lurking around in 
supposedly empty rooms, but personally 
I think someone's probably just slacking 
off on the job.""
""But...""
""There's no such thing as ghosts!"" 
Emma was clearly getting flustered.
""Okay, settle down. I don't believe in 
ghost stories, either.""
""I know! Stupid, aren't they?"" Emma 
looked relieved.
""Right. But I don't want to rule out any 
possibilities. Do you think anyone could 
have gotten in here without 
authorization?""
Emma thought for a minute. ""...Big Shell 
is almost completely automated, so 
most of it's inaccessible to people. 
But yeah, I guess it might be possible. 
Still...""
Suddenly, the door to the Dining Hall 
burst open. Enemy guards started 
pouring into the room, shouting angrily.

""'Legend'? So this 'ghost' story has 
been around for a while?""
""Yeah. They say that there was this one 
employee a long time ago whose son 
died, and he tried to kill himself, but he 
didn't really die, he just got really 
mangled and stuff, and now he haunts 
the place.... You know, that sort of 
thing.""
Something in Emma's eyes seemed to 
flicker for a moment, but she quickly 
recovered. Her voice became cheerful 
again.
""Hey, these kinds of places always have 
one or two ghost stories associated with 
them, right?... Some people say they've 
seen shadows lurking around in 
supposedly empty rooms, but personally 
I think someone's probably just slacking 
off on the job.""
""But...""
""There's no such thing as ghosts!"" 
Emma was clearly getting flustered.
""Okay, settle down. I don't believe in 
ghost stories, either.""
""I know! Stupid, aren't they?"" Emma 
looked relieved.
""Right. But I don't want to rule out any 
possibilities. Do you think anyone could 
have gotten in here without 
authorization?""
Emma thought for a minute. ""...Big Shell 
is almost completely automated, so 
most of it's inaccessible to people. 
But yeah, I guess it might be possible. 
Still...""
Suddenly, the door to the Dining Hall 
burst open. Enemy guards started 
pouring into the room, shouting angrily. 
It looked like their conversation had 
dragged on a little bit too long. Snake 
grunted in frustration. It was tough to 
concentrate with Emma around.
""Emma! Get down!"" Snake yelled as 
he drew his USP.#C0

to avoid Snake's gaze.
""Emma?""
""...I know I've only known you for 10 
minutes, but I've already learned 
something about you.""
""What's that?""
""You're just like them. You're good at

strong face on, but her voice was 
wavering.

one law: kill or be killed. That's what's 
kept me alive so far. And that's the only 
thing that's keeping you alive right now. 
If you want to survive, you'd better 
learn to be strong.""
Emma raised her head. ""...I just learned 
something else about you. You're also 
good at justifying yourself, aren't you?""
Emma drew closer to Snake.

others. It was a face exhausted by

emanating from an unseen speaker. It 
sounded like some kind of building-wide

were talking about? Snake called Otacon 
via the Codec.

gave me?""
""No, that's just a security card. It's 
only good for opening doors. The

an actual key that only Big Shell's 
system administrator would have access 
to. It acts as a verification device.

to Big Shell's computer system without 
it. The terrorists need it to release the

the other.
""That's it! Why didn't I think of it 
before?""
""What?""
""Emma said she had her own card with 
her, right? Security cards in Big Shell

""Drugs!""
Emma related a story she'd heard from 
one of the guards while she was being 
held captive.
The armed group that had taken over 
Big Shell belonged to a Russian crime 
syndicate. With the collaboration of a 
number of employees in the facility, the 
syndicate was using Big Shell as a 
waypoint in their drug smuggle 
operations. At night they'd sneak the 
drugs from smuggling ships out at sea 
into Big Shell using small boats. Then 
they'd slip the drugs in with the 
outgoing cargo from Big Shell and get 
them into the country that way. Security 
in the harbor had been getting tighter in 
recent years, and this was a convenient 
and effective way of getting the goods 
through without being exposed.
One month earlier, they'd brought in a 
600 kg shipment of drugs with a street 
value of over $7 million. The following 
day, two of the employees who were 
working with the syndicate were killed 
in two consecutive accidents. The 
syndicate immediately sent one of their 
men in to investigate, but he too was 
killed in an accident shortly after 
arriving.
The leaders of the syndicate decided 
that these incidents were the work of a 
rival syndicate that had been competing 
with them in the drug trade and that 
were now trying to seize their shipment. 
They'd sent in their troops in to recover
the drugs, leading to the current 
situation. 
""So the 'ghost of Big Shell' is...""
A mischievous grin spread across 
Emma's face. ""Exactly. It's not a ghost 
at all. It's just a plain old hitman who's 
been sent by the rival syndicate to 
steal the drugs.""
""...And you told them that I'm the 
hitman.""
""Well... yeah, but what's done is done, 
right? No use arguing about it.""
Snake decided not to pursue the matter 
any further. He changed the subject. 
""So where could they be hiding such a 
huge amount of drugs in Big Shell?""
""I have no clue. I didn't have any idea 
what was going on. I'm still having 
trouble believing it even now....""
Snake, too, was puzzled. How could it 
be possible for a few employees to 
keep hundreds of kilograms of drugs 
hidden in Big Shell without the others 
finding out? He couldn't afford to waste 
any more time thinking about it, though. 
The hostages' lives were still in danger.
""The hostages are still in the Shell 2 
Core, aren't they?""
""Yeah...."" Emma tried to get up and 
stumbled. She slowly staggered to her 
feet.
""Are you all right?"" Snake asked.
""Yeah, I'm fine.... Actually, the 
terrorists injected me with something. 
They said it was to keep me from 
running away again. I think it was some 
kind of tranquilizer.... Now my feet feel 
like they weigh about a ton each....""
Emma started to lose her balance 
again. Snake caught her as she fell. 
Even in her incapacitated state, she'd 
managed to extract information from the 
enemy, and never lost sight of her

full of surprises. In that respect, at 
least, she resembled her stepbrother.

to return the favor if I can. I know

friends!""
""I know that! Just wait one more 
minute!"" Emma began to punch 
commands into the node with incredible 
speed.
""What the hell are you up to now?""
""If we run now, they'll just come after 
us. So...""
Within seconds, Snake could hear the 
sounds of a crowd beginning to gather 
outside the door. Footsteps, voices 
barking orders, rifles being cocked. 
They'd come crashing into the room 
any minute now. Emma, however, 
remained glued to the screen of the 
node.
""Emma!"" yelled Snake.
She finally detached herself from the 
node. ""There, that should do it. Okay, 
then, let's get going!""
The door burst open. #C0
","Snake and Emma arrived at Strut E. 
Emma's eyes were drawn to a nearby 
conveyor belt.
""I've got it!"" she exclaimed.
""Got what?""
""I know where they hid the drugs."" 
Emma went over to the node and 
immediately began punching in 
commands.
""How do you...""
""Just wait and see.""
A second later, the conveyor belt spat 
out a crate. Emma opened it. It was 
packed tightly with plastic bags full of 
white powder.
""The syndicate guys knew that no 
matter how good the hiding spot, 
someone was sure to find the drugs if 
they hid them in just one place,"" 
said Emma as they watched more and 
more crates arrive via the conveyor 
belt. ""So they hid the drugs in these 
crates and set them up so they'd just 
go around and around Big Shell without 
actually coming out anywhere.""
Snake couldn't help but admire the 
girl's brilliance. He watched as Emma 
took out her PDA and connected it to 
the node.
""Now what are you doing?"" he said.
""Hmm. I think I might have found 
something interesting here.... this must 
be...""
Just then, a figure emerged from 
behind the conveyor belt. It was one of 
the terrorists. As soon as he spotted 
Snake and Emma standing there, he 
ran away. Snake moved to pursue the 
escaping terrorist, but Emma grabbed 
his hand.
""Wait!""
""Let go! He's going to go call his 
friends!""
""I know that! Just wait one more 
minute!"" Emma began to punch 
commands into the node with incredible 
speed.

Strut E, keeping an eye on their rear. 
The terrorists would be coming after 
them any moment now. He slapped a 
new cartridge into the chamber of his 
gun and shouted at Emma, urging her 
to move quickly towards Strut D. She 
responded with a nonchalant look.
""There's no need to be in such a hurry, 
you know,"" she said.
They waited a while, but the door to 
Strut E remained shut. From the other 
side, they could hear a tumult as the 
soldiers bashed in vain against the tightly
sealed door. Snake turned to Emma.
""What did you do?""
""I programmed the node to seal off all 
the doors to Strut E once we were out 
safely. Those guys aren't going 
anywhere."" Emma looked extremely 
proud of herself. It seemed she'd 
picked up a thing or two from her 
experience with Snake in Strut C.
They entered Strut D. Snake looked 
around for signs of the enemy, but 
there was no one in sight. The 
terrorists must have sent the bulk of 
their forces to Strut E. If that were 
true, then the rest of the struts would 
be nearly deserted. Rescuing the 
hostages would be a breeze.
Snake and Emma passed through Strut 
D and emerged onto the Shell 1 - 2 
connecting bridge. Here, too, the 
enemy was nowhere to be seen. Emma 
smiled her characteristic smile.
""See, no problems at all. Didn't I say 
I'd come in handy?""
""I have to admit, you were pretty good 
back there,"" Snake said with a nod. He 
recalled the way Emma had connected 
to the node using her PDA. ""By the 
way, weren't you downloading 
something back there?""
""Yeah. Was it that obvious?"" Emma 
took out her PDA. ""When I was 
activating the conveyor belt, I found a 
suspicious-looking hidden file next to 
the conveyor belt control file. I decided 
to download it, and this is what I 
found....""
The screen of her PDA displayed the 
file. It appeared to be some kind of note
from one of the two employees who'd 
been killed in the accidents -- the same 
ones who were helping the syndicate 
smuggle drugs into Big Shell. In it, he 
explained that he was only cooperating 
with the Russians because his wife and 
child were being held hostage. But last 
year, he found out that they'd already 
been killed while trying to escape. He 
fell into a deep despair, and at one 
point he even thought of killing himself. 
But then he had a vision. It was still too 
early for him to die. No, he had to get 
his revenge on the syndicate first. 
Indeed, he'd make them pay in blood 
for what they did to his wife and child.
Over the course of the next year, he 
devised an ingenious plan. He'd make it 
look like he was killed by a rival 
syndicate that was trying to steal the 
drugs. This would start a war between 
the two syndicates that would end up 
destroying both. First, he faked his own 
disappearance. Shortly afterward, 
he used a crane to crush the man the 
syndicate had sent to watch him. 
When the Mafia sent a man to 
investigate both incidents, he threw him 
into the ocean. 
Just as he'd expected, a war erupted 
between the two rival syndicates. With 
everything in place, he could finally rest 
in peace. He said he was going to join 
his wife and child. 
Finally, he implored the person reading 
the memo to say a prayer for his 
departed wife and child. The file 
ended there. It was dated three days 
ago.
Snake looked up from the PDA. 
""...I guess this means the 'ghost of Big 
Shell' is dead?""
Emma was unable to hide her shock. 
""I... I guess so.... Actually, I 
downloaded one more file....""
Snake's ears picked up a faint sound of 
something flying through the air. 
Instantly, he grabbed Emma and held 
her tight. There was an explosion. The 
force of the blast knocked Snake and 
Emma off their feet.
""What was that?"" Emma groaned in 
Snake's arms.
A thunderous gale of wind beat against 
their cheeks. Hovering over the bridge, 
beyond the wavering heat from the 
blast, was the Harrier.
""Oh yeah, I guess there WAS 
something that could get out of Strut 
E...."" Emma muttered, a look of blank 
amazement on her face. The Harrier 
strafed the bridge with waves of 
machine-gun fire. Snake and Emma 
fled back to the entrance to Strut D.
""Now what do we do?""
""I guess we'll just have to kill it.""
""How?""
""I'll think of something.""
""Are you serious?!"" Emma began to 
protest, but before she could finish, 
Snake thrust her through the door of 
Strut D.
""What are you doing?"" she demanded.
""Stay there! No matter what happens, 
don't come out here!""
""But!""
""Just listen to me for once, okay?"" 
Snake smiled at her. ""I already 
promised someone I'd bring you back 
with me.""
""Wha-""
The door slammed shut.
Snake heard the sound of a helicopter 
approaching. It was Otacon in his 
Kasatka.
""Snake, use this!""
Otacon tossed down a box from the 
cockpit. Stinger missiles. With these, 
it became somewhat of an even fight. 
Snake turned and prepared to face the 
Harrier in battle.#C0

Nevertheless, it contained a wealth of 
information related to the syndicate's

Snake fronça les sourcils. Les « services »
d'Otacon sont toujours synonymes d'ennuis,
se dit-il.
""Ne compte pas sur moi. Je ne sais pas ce
que tu as en tête cette fois, mais tes
croisades à la noix auxquelles personne ne
comprend rien, c'est fini pour moi.""
""Ce n'est rien de tout cela. C'est... ma
sœur.""
""Ta sœur ?""
""Oui, ma sœur Emma."" Otacon raconta son
histoire d'un ton grave. Il venait d'apprendre
que sa demi-sœur, qu'il avait perdue de vue
depuis longtemps, travaillait comme
programmeuse sur une usine de
décontamination maritime, appelée la Big
Shell, dans la Baie de Manhattan.
""Attends. La Big Shell... n'est-ce pas là
que... ?""
""Précisément. Donc toi aussi tu es au
courant.""
Il y avait récemment eu une série de morts
accidentelles parmi les employés de la Big
Shell. Beaucoup de bruits circulaient sur la
cause de leur mort. On parlait d'un tueur en
série en fuite, d'employés qui perdaient la
tête à cause de la réclusion et même de
fantômes. Symbole de responsabilité
écologique, la Big Shell était devenue un
sujet lucratif pour les journaux.
""Je suis inquiet pour Emma. Tu veux aller
vérifier qu'elle ne craint rien ?""
Snake fut un signe de refus de la main.
""Adresse-toi à la police.""
""Tu sais bien qu'ils ne lèveront pas le petit
doigt.""
""Et tu t'imagines que moi je le ferai ?""
""J'ai un mauvais pressentiment. Va voir pour
moi, tu veux ?""
""Vas-y toi-même.""
""S'il te plaît !""
""Pas question !""
""Je te répète, Snake, que j'ai VRAIMENT
un mauvais pressentiment ! Je t'en prie,
vas-y !""
""Laisse-moi tranquille !""

Six heures plus tard, Snake se retrouva
dans l'héliport de la Big Shell, juste au
moment où un groupe d'hommes armés
envahissait l'usine. Snake se cacha derrière
un cageot. À ce moment même, Otacon
l'appela sur le Codec.
""... À ton avis, ce sont des terroristes ?""
demanda-t-il.
""J'ignore. Mais ce qui est clair, c'est que la
situation est un peu plus dangereuse
qu'avant. Bravo. Tu as deviné juste, je
crois.""
""Ce n'est pas très rassurant. J'espère
qu'Emma ne craint rien...""
""Moi aussi,"" répondit Snake. Ses yeux
s'arrêtèrent sur un Harrier stationné dans
l'héliport. ""Et ce Harrier ? Est-ce qu'il leur
appartient ?""
""Non, il appartient aux marines. Il semble
qu'ils aient eu un problème pendant un
entraînement il y a trois jours et qu'ils aient
dû faire un atterrissage d'urgence.""
Snake hocha la tête. ""Commençons par le
commencement. Il faut savoir ce qui se
passe ici. J'entre.""
""Compris. Fais attention. Au fait, Snake...""
""Quoi ?""
""Si tu trouves Emma, ne lui parle pas de
moi, d'accord ?""
""Et pourquoi ?""
""Eh bien... nous ne nous sommes pas vus
depuis longtemps... c'est trop soudain...""
Otacon hésita. Snake comprit qu'Otacon lui
cachait quelque chose. Il décida de ne pas
insister et se dirigea vers la Big Shell.#C0
","""Snake, j'ai un service à te demander,"" dit
Otacon.
Snake fronça les sourcils. Les « services »
d'Otacon sont toujours synonymes d'ennuis,
se dit-il.
""Ne compte pas sur moi. Je ne sais pas ce
que tu as en tête cette fois, mais tes
croisades à la noix auxquelles personne ne
comprend rien, c'est fini pour moi.""
""Ce n'est rien de tout cela. C'est... ma
sœur.""
""Ta sœur ?""
""Oui, ma sœur Emma."" Otacon raconta son
histoire d'un ton grave. Il venait d'apprendre
que sa demi-sœur, qu'il avait perdue de vue
depuis longtemps, travaillait comme
programmeuse sur une usine de
décontamination maritime, appelée la Big
Shell, dans la Baie de Manhattan.
""Attends. La Big Shell... n'est-ce pas là
que... ?""
""Précisément. Donc toi aussi tu es au
courant.""
Il y avait récemment eu une série de morts
accidentelles parmi les employés de la Big
Shell. Beaucoup de bruits circulaient sur la
cause de leur mort. On parlait d'un tueur en
série en fuite, d'employés qui perdaient la
tête à cause de la réclusion et même de
fantômes. Symbole de responsabilité
écologique, la Big Shell était devenue un
sujet lucratif pour les journaux.
""Je suis inquiet pour Emma. Tu veux aller
vérifier qu'elle ne craint rien ?""
Snake fut un signe de refus de la main.
""Adresse-toi à la police.""
""Tu sais bien qu'ils ne lèveront pas le petit
doigt.""
""Et tu t'imagines que moi je le ferai ?""
""J'ai un mauvais pressentiment. Va voir pour
moi, tu veux ?""
""Vas-y toi-même.""
""S'il te plaît !""
""Pas question !""
""Je te répète, Snake, que j'ai VRAIMENT
un mauvais pressentiment ! Je t'en prie,
vas-y !""
""Laisse-moi tranquille !""
|
Six heures plus tard, Snake se retrouva
dans l'héliport de la Big Shell, juste au
moment où un groupe d'hommes armés
envahissait l'usine. Snake se cacha derrière
un cageot. À ce moment même, Otacon
l'appela sur le Codec.
""... À ton avis, ce sont des terroristes ?""
demanda-t-il.
""J'ignore. Mais ce qui est clair, c'est que la
situation est un peu plus dangereuse
qu'avant. Bravo. Tu as deviné juste, je
crois.""
""Ce n'est pas très rassurant. J'espère
qu'Emma ne craint rien...""
""Moi aussi,"" répondit Snake. Ses yeux
s'arrêtèrent sur un Harrier stationné dans
l'héliport. ""Et ce Harrier ? Est-ce qu'il leur
appartient ?""
""Non, il appartient aux marines. Il semble
qu'ils aient eu un problème pendant un
entraînement il y a trois jours et qu'ils aient
dû faire un atterrissage d'urgence.""
Snake hocha la tête. ""Commençons par le
commencement. Il faut savoir ce qui se
passe ici. J'entre.""
""Compris. Fais attention. Au fait, Snake...""
""Quoi ?""
""Si tu trouves Emma, ne lui parle pas de
moi, d'accord ?""
""Et pourquoi ?""
""Eh bien... nous ne nous sommes pas vus
depuis longtemps... c'est trop soudain...""
Otacon hésita. Snake comprit qu'Otacon lui
cachait quelque chose. Il décida de ne pas
insister et se dirigea vers la Big Shell.#C0

parcourut Snake. La fille, c'était Emma,
sans aucun doute. Avaient-ils déjà mis la
main sur elle ? Et quelle était cette clé de
contrôle ? Snake appela Otacon sur le

""Ils ont pris Emma !?"" Otacon explosa.
""Qu'est-ce que tu...""

""Non, c'est une simple carte de sécurité.
Elle sert à ouvrir les portes, c'est tout. La
clé de contrôle est une clé à laquelle seul
l'administrateur du système de la Big Shell

vérification. En gros, tu ne peux rien
changer au système informatique de la Big

donné d'autre ?""

Dans le Codec, Snake entendit Otacon
claquer dans ses mains.
""Je sais ! Pourquoi n'y ai-je pas pensé plus
tôt ?""

""Emma a sa propre carte. Les cartes de

et 2 était déverrouillée. Alors que Snake
s'apprêtait à retourner à l'Etai C, une voix
sortit d'un haut-parleur invisible. On aurait
dit une annonce générale.
""Message à l'attention du fantôme de la Big
Shell. Il vous est ordonné de déverrouiller le
système avec la clé de contrôle que la fille
vous a donnée. Vous avez 15 minutes pour
le faire. Sinon, nous tuerons la fille. Je
répète...""
La voix répéta l'avertissement. Un frisson
parcourut Snake. La fille, c'était Emma,
sans aucun doute. Avaient-ils déjà mis la
main sur elle ? Et quelle était cette clé de
contrôle ? Snake appela Otacon sur le
Codec.
""Ils ont pris Emma !?"" Otacon explosa.
""Qu'est-ce que tu...""
""Calme-toi. Je cherche un moyen de la
sauver.""
La voix d'Otacon retrouva son calme.
""Bien.""
""Cette clé de contrôle, se pourrait-il que ce
soit la carte qu'Emma m'a donnée ?""
""Non, c'est une simple carte de sécurité.
Elle sert à ouvrir les portes, c'est tout. La
clé de contrôle est une clé à laquelle seul
l'administrateur du système de la Big Shell
peut avoir accès. C'est un dispositif de
vérification. En gros, tu ne peux rien
changer au système informatique de la Big
Shell sans elle. Les terroristes la veulent
pour déverrouiller le système...""
""Et s'ils tapaient un mot de passe comme je
l'ai fait ?""
""Ça ne marcherait pas. Les mots de passe
vont jusqu'au niveau de sécurité 3
seulement. Après, il faut la clé de contrôle
pour accéder...""
""Tu as l'air de t'y connaître.""
""Snake, es-tu sûr qu'Emma ne t'a rien
donné d'autre ?""
""Oui. Et d'abord, qu'est-ce qui leur fait dire
que je l'ai ?""
""... Emma leur a peut-être menti.""
""Ou bien elle l'a donnée au vrai fantôme de
la Big Shell.""
""Ce n'est pas possible,"" dit Otacon
rapidement.
""Comment peux-tu en être si sûr ?""
rétorqua Snake.
""Hé, tu as dis toi-même que les fantômes
n'existent pas, non ? Dépêchons-nous de
sauver Emma !""
""Tu as raison. Mais nous ne savons même
pas où elle est...""
Dans le Codec, Snake entendit Otacon
claquer dans ses mains.
""Je sais ! Pourquoi n'y ai-je pas pensé plus
tôt ?""
""Quoi ?""
""Emma a sa propre carte. Les cartes de
sécurité de la Big Shell fonctionnent par
identification par fréquence radio. Chaque
carte IFR possède une puce qui envoie les
données par signal radio. Les lecteurs de
carte peuvent utiliser ces signaux pour
détecter tous les ID à moins d'une certaine
distance. Toutes les données de la Big Shell
sont gérées par un système intégré
accessible avec un mot de passe de niveau
3 !"" Otacon parlait vite.
""... Ce qui veut dire ?"" dit Snake.
""Que tu peux utiliser le nœud pour savoir
dans quel étai Emma se trouve ! Snake,
essaie d'accéder au nœud avec le mot de
passe.""
Snake fit comme Otacon l'avait dit et une
faible lumière apparut à l'écran, dans l'Etai
F.

découvert ce que les terroristes
recherchent !""
""Qu'est-ce que c'est ?""
""De la drogue !""
Emma raconta ce qu'elle avait entendu un
garde dire pendant sa captivité.
Le groupe armé qui avait pris la Big Shell
d'assaut appartenait à un groupe criminel
russe. Avec la collaboration de plusieurs
employés de l'usine, le groupe utilisait la Big
Shell comme relais dans leur trafic de
drogue. La nuit, ils envoyaient des
chaloupes chercher la drogue sur des
navires de contrebande et la transvasaient
sur la Big Shell. La drogue quittait la Big
Shell dans la cargaison. C'est ainsi qu'elle
entrait dans le pays. La sécurité ayant été
resserrée dans le port ces dernières
années, c'était un moyen pratique et
efficace de transférer la drogue sans
s'exposer.
Un mois plus tôt, ils avaient récupéré 600
kilos de drogue, d'une valeur marchande de
plus de 7 millions de dollars. Le lendemain,
deux des employés du groupe mouraient
coup sur coup dans un accident. Le groupe
envoya immédiatement un de ses hommes
enquêter, mais lui aussi est mort dans un
accident peu de temps après son arrivée.
Les chefs du groupe conclurent que ces
incidents étaient l'œuvre d'un groupe rival
qui essayait de se débarrasser de son
concurrent et de s'emparer de la
marchandise. Ils envoyèrent leurs troupes
récupérer la drogue. D'où la situation
actuelle.
""Donc, le « fantôme » c'est...""
Un sourire malicieux apparut sur le visage
d'Emma. ""Exactement. Ce n'est pas un
fantôme du tout. C'est juste un tueur envoyé
par le groupe rival pour voler la drogue.""
""... Et tu leur as dit que j'étais ce tueur.""
""Bien... oui, mais ce qui est fait est fait,
d'accord ? Inutile de revenir là-dessus.""
Snake décida de ne plus en parler. Il
changea de conservation. ""Mais où
peuvent-ils cacher une telle quantité de
drogue dans la Big Shell ?""
""Je n'en sais rien. J'ignorais ce qui se
passait. J'ai encore du mal à y croire, même
maintenant...""
Snake aussi était sidéré. Comment était-il
possible qu'une poignée d'employés cachent
des centaines de kilos de drogue dans la
Big Shell à l'insu des autres ? Mais il
n'avait pas le temps de réfléchir. La vie des
otages était toujours en danger.
""Les otages sont toujours dans le noyau de
la Shell 2 ?""
""Oui..."" Emma essaya de se lever mais
trébucha. Doucement, elle se mit debout.
""Ça va ?"" demanda Snake.
""Oui, ça va... En fait, ils m'ont fait une
piqûre de quelque chose. Pour m'empêcher
de m'enfuir, soit disant. Un genre de
tranquillisant... J'ai l'impression que mes
pieds pèsent une tonne chacun...""
Emma perdit à nouveau l'équilibre. Snake la
rattrapa comme elle allait tomber. Même
dans son état, elle avait réussi à soutirer
des informations à l'ennemi, sans jamais
perdre de vue son objectif. Décidément,
cette fille réservait des surprises. À cet
égard du moins, elle ressemblait à son
demi-frère.
""Ça va. Tu ferais mieux de te cacher.""
""Pas question. Je viens avec toi.""
""Mais...""
""S'il te plaît."" Les yeux d'Emma
rencontrèrent ceux de Snake.
""Tu m'as sauvé la vie deux fois. Je veux te
rendre la pareille si je le peux. Je sais que
je peux être utile... S'il te plaît !""
Snake céda. Pour accéder au noyau de la
Shell 1, il fallait traverser la passerelle
reliant les Shells 1 et 2 à partir de l'Etai D.
Ils se mirent en route pour l'Etai D.#C0

force de l'impact les souleva de leurs pieds.

l'aide d'une grue. Peu de temps après, il
poussa l'homme envoyé par la Mafia pour
enquêter sur les deux incidents par-dessus
bord. Comme il l'avait prévu, une guerre
éclata entre les groupes rivaux. Tout étant
maintenant en place, il pouvait enfin reposer
en paix. Il dit qu'il allait bientôt rejoindre sa
femme et son fils. Pour finir, il implorait le
lecteur de dire une prière pour sa femme et
son fils. Le fichier s'arrêtait là. Il datait d'il y
a trois jours.
Snake leva la tête. ""Ça veut sans doute dire
que le fantôme de la Big Shell est mort?""
Emma ne pouvait masquer sa surprise.
""Je... je suppose... J'ai téléchargé un autre
fichier...""
Les oreilles de Snake perçurent un bruit au
loin, comme si quelque chose volait dans
l'air. Instantanément, il attrapa Emma et la
serra contre lui. Il y eut une explosion. La
force de l'impact les souleva de leurs pieds.
""Qu'est-ce que c'était ?"" marmonna Emma
dans ses bras.
Un vent puissant leur fouettait les joues. Le
Harrier planait au-dessus de la passerelle,
loin de la fournaise de l'explosion.
""Oh non... Il pouvait sortir quelque chose
de l'Etai E..."" murmura Emma, l'air
complètement abasourdi.
Le Harrier balayait la passerelle à la
mitraillette. Snake et Emma s'enfuirent vers
l'entrée de la passerelle D.
""Qu'est-ce qu'on fait maintenant ?""
""Il va falloir l'abattre.""
""Comment ?""
""Je vais bien trouver.""
""Tu plaisantes !?"" Emma se mit à
protester, mais avant qu'elle ait pu terminer,
Snake l'avait poussée derrière la porte de
l'Etai D.
""Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?"" demanda-t-elle.
""Reste là ! Quoi qu'il arrive, ne sors pas de
là !""
""Mais !""
""Écoute-moi pour une fois, tu veux ?""
Snake lui sourit. ""J'ai promis à quelqu'un de
te ramener avec moi.""
""Quoi ?""
La porte se referma.
Snake entendit le bruit d'un hélicoptère qui
approchait. C'était Otacon dans son
Kasatka.
""Prends ça, Snake !""
Otacon balança une boîte du cockpit. Des
missiles Stinger. Avec ça, les forces
devenaient plus équilibrées. Snake se
retourna et se prépara à affronter
le Harrier.#C0

eine Änderung am System vor, damit sie es
nicht mehr benutzen konnten. ""Damit

nacheinander. Und dann verschwand der
andere, der gerade hergekommen war, auch
noch ... Aber das waren alles Unfälle,
klar? Man bringt das mit einer dummen,
kindischen Sage in Zusammenhang ...""
""'Sage'? Machte diese
'Gespenstergeschichte' schon eine Zeitlang
die Runde?""
""Ja. Vor langer Zeit starb einem Mitarbeiter
der Sohn. Da soll er versucht haben,
Selbstmord zu begehen, starb aber nicht
wirklich, sondern wurde verstümmelt und
jetzt soll er hier als Gespenst erscheinen...
etwas in der Art.""
Für einen Moment schien etwas in Emmas
Augen zu flackern, aber sie fing sich
schnell. Ihre Stimme wurde wieder heiter.
""Solche Orte sind immer mit ein zwei
Gespenstergeschichten verbunden, richtig?
Manche wollen in leeren Räumen
herumlauernde Schatten gesehen haben,
aber ich persönlich glaube, dass ihnen da
ihre Sinne einen Streich gespielt haben.""

""Schon gut, beruhigen Sie sich. Ich glaube
auch nicht an Gespenstergeschichten.""
""Ich weiß! Die sind einfach dumm, nicht
wahr?"" Emma sah erleichtert aus.
""Richtig. Aber ich möchte keine Möglichkeit
ausschließen. Glauben Sie, dass jemand
ohne Befugnis hier hereinkommen konnte?""
Emma dachte kurz nach. ""... Big Shell ist
fast vollständig automatisiert und deshalb ist
der größte Teil für Menschen nicht
zugänglich. Aber ich glaube, es könnte
schon möglich sein. Obwohl...""
Plötzlich sprang die Tür zum Speisesaal auf.
Immer mehr feindliche Wächter kamen in
den Raum und schrien sich verärgert an. Ihr
Gespräch schien etwas zu lange gedauert
zu haben. Snake räusperte sich frustriert. In
Emmas Nähe konnte er sich nur schwer
konzentrieren.
""Emma! Runter!"" schrie Snake und zog
dabei seine USP.#C0
","Langsam näherte sich Snake der jungen
Frau, die sich in der Ecke des
Speiselagerschranks zusammenkauerte.
""Sie sind Emma, nicht wahr?""
""Wer sind Sie? Woher wissen Sie, wie ich
heiße!?""
""Keine Sorge"", sagte Snake, um sie zu
beruhigen. ""Ich bin auf Ihrer Seite. Ich will
Sie retten!""
""Sie sind... auf meiner Seite?""
""So ist es.""
""Sie wollen mich retten?""
""Ja.""
""... Wirklich?""
""Wirklich.""
Emma sah Snake misstrauisch an.
""... Sehe ich denn so vertrauensunwürdig
aus?"" fragte Snake.
""Sie haben wohl keinen Spiegel im Haus?""
Snake wollte protestieren, aber Emma war
schneller.
""Ist auch egal. Warum genau wollen Sie
mich denn retten?""
Snake dachte an Otacons Worte - gleich
was passiert, mein Name wird nicht
erwähnt.
""Das kann ich Ihnen nicht sagen.""
""Warum nicht?""
""Weil ich es eben nicht kann.""
Emma betrachtete Snake von Kopf bis Fuß.
Sie sah nicht sonderlich überzeugt aus,
schien aber ihr Misstrauen aufzugeben.
""... Für einen Helden klingen Sie nicht sehr
überzeugend. Aber wie ein Böser sehen Sie
auch nicht aus. Wie heißen Sie eigentlich?""
""Solid Snake.""
Plötzlich stand Emma auf und fasste Snake
am Ohr.
""Hal-LO? Habla alemán? Ich habe nach
Ihrem NAMEN gefragt und nicht nach dem
SPITZNAMEN. Gott, was für ein Freak!""
Emma ließ Snakes Ohr los und sah ihm
direkt in die Augen. ""Wie ist - Ihr -
RICHTIGER - Name?""
""Ich habe keinen mehr.""
""Wie?""
""Die Leute in meinem Beruf brauchen keine
Namen.""
Emmas Gesicht verfinsterte sich etwas. ""...
Hmm. Sie sind vielleicht kein Böser, aber
auf jeden Fall etwas komisch. Aber egal.
Also... Solid?""
""Nennen Sie mich Snake."" Er seufzte. Das
Gespräch mit dieser Frau war anstrengend.
""Mann, mit Namen haben Sie es aber, nicht
wahr? Also gut, SNAKE, Sie sind...""
Snake unterbracht sie. ""Darf ich ein paar
Fragen stellen, ja?""
""... Aber sicher.""
""Warum suchen die Terroristen nach
Ihnen?""
""Vielleicht finden sie mich unwiderstehlich
attraktiv.""
Snake fiel darauf nichts ein. Emma schien
ein bisschen enttäuscht zu sein.
""... Oder vielleicht weil ich das Kennwort für
das Computersystem geändert und sie somit
ausgeperrt habe.""
""Was meinen Sie damit?""
Emma erzählte. Sie hatte gesehen, wie die
Terroristen versucht hatten, mit dem
Computersystem von Big Shell irgendetwas
zu bewirken. Nach einem
Ablenkungsmanöver entkam sie und nahm
eine Änderung am System vor, damit sie es
nicht mehr benutzen konnten. ""Damit
gewann ich Zeit und glaubte, dass es sie
zusätzlich noch irritieren würde.""
Wahrscheinlich ging es ihr mehr um das
Letztere, dachte Snake. ""Was wollen die
Terroristen denn mit dem System
bewirken?""
""Wie soll ich das wissen?""
""Hat es etwas mit dem 'Gespenst von Big
Shell zu tun?""
""Was meinen Sie damit?"" Emma stellte
sich überrascht.
""Sie sagten, dass ein paar ihrer Kumpane
vom 'Gespenst von Big Shell' getötet
wurden. Wer ist denn dieses 'Gespenst', von
dem sie sprechen, überhaupt?""
Emma starrte Snake voll Abscheu an.
""Warum sehen Sie mich so an?""
""Das 'Gespenst von Big Shell'? Sowas
Lächerliches!"" Sie bewegte die Hände
über dem Kopf hin und her. ""Sicher
stimmt es, dass drei von ihnen im letzten
Monat umgekommen sind. Das war schon
echt traurig. Zwei verschwanden
nacheinander. Und dann verschwand der
andere, der gerade hergekommen war, auch
noch ... Aber das waren alles Unfälle,
klar? Man bringt das mit einer dummen,
kindischen Sage in Zusammenhang ...""
""'Sage'? Machte diese
'Gespenstergeschichte' schon eine Zeitlang
die Runde?""
""Ja. Vor langer Zeit starb einem Mitarbeiter
der Sohn. Da soll er versucht haben,
Selbstmord zu begehen, starb aber nicht
wirklich, sondern wurde verstümmelt und
jetzt soll er hier als Gespenst erscheinen...
etwas in der Art.""
Für einen Moment schien etwas in Emmas
Augen zu flackern, aber sie fing sich
schnell. Ihre Stimme wurde wieder heiter.
""Solche Orte sind immer mit ein zwei
Gespenstergeschichten verbunden, richtig?
Manche wollen in leeren Räumen
herumlauernde Schatten gesehen haben,
aber ich persönlich glaube, dass ihnen da
ihre Sinne einen Streich gespielt haben.""
""Aber...""
""Es gibt keine Gespenster!"" Emma wurde
ganz aufgeregt.
""Schon gut, beruhigen Sie sich. Ich glaube
auch nicht an Gespenstergeschichten.""
""Ich weiß! Die sind einfach dumm, nicht
wahr?"" Emma sah erleichtert aus.
""Richtig. Aber ich möchte keine Möglichkeit

Emma erzählte eine Geschichte, die sie von
einem Wächter gehört hatte, während sie
gefangen war.
Die bewaffnete Gruppe, die Big Shell
besetzt hatte, gehörte zu einem russischen
Verbrechersyndikat. Das Syndikat nutzte Big
Shell als Zwischenstation bei seinen
Drogenschmuggeloperationen und konnte
sich dabei auf mehrere Mitarbeiter der
Anlage verlassen. Bei Nacht brachten sie
die Drogen von Schmuggelschiffen auf See
heimlich mit kleinen Booten in Big Shell
hinein. Dann versteckten Sie die Drogen in
der von Big Shell abgehenden Fracht und
brachten sie auf diese Weise in das Land.
Die Sicherheitsmaßnahmen im Hafen waren
in den letzten Jahren verstärkt worden, aber
dies war ein bequemer und effektiver Weg,
um die Ware unentdeckt durchzubekommen.
Vor einem Monat hatten sie eine
600-kg-Lieferung mit einem Straßenwert von
mehr als 7 Millionen Dollar gebracht. Am
Tag darauf kamen zwei Mitarbeiter, die mit
dem Syndikat zusammenarbeiteten, bei zwei
aufeinanderfolgenden Unfällen um. Das
Syndikat schickte sofort einen seiner Leute
zur Untersuchung, aber auch er kam kurz
nach seinem Eintreffen bei einem Unfall um.
Die Anführer des Syndikats meinten, dass
bei diesen Vorfällen ein rivalisierendes
Syndikat am Werk gewesen wäre, das ihnen
den Drogenhandel streitig machte und jetzt
ihre Lieferung abfangen wollte. Sie schickten
ihre Truppen, um die Drogen sicherzustellen
und das hatte zur aktuellen Situation
geführt.
""Das 'Gespenst von Big Shell' ist also...""
Ein schelmisches Grinsen breitete sich über
Emmas Gesicht. ""Genau. Es ist überhaupt
kein Gespenst. Es ist einfach ein Killer, den
das rivalisierende Syndikat geschickt hat,
um die Drogen zu stehlen.""
""... Und Sie haben ihnen gesagt, dass ich
der Killer sei.""
""Nun... ja, aber geschehen ist geschehen,
richtig? Streiten hilft da jetzt nicht.""
Snake beschloss, der Sache nicht weiter
nachzugehen. Er wechselte das Thema.
""Wo könnten sie in Big Shell so eine große
Menge Drogen verstecken?""
""Ich habe keine Ahnung. Ich wußte
überhaupt nicht, was da vor sich ging.
Selbst jetzt fällt es mir noch schwer, das zu
glauben...""
Auch Snake erschien es rätselhaft. Wie
konnten ein paar Mitarbeiter hunderte Kilo
Drogen in Big Shell verstecken, ohne dass
es die anderen bemerkten? Aber er hatte
keine Zeit mehr, weiter darüber
nachzusinnen. Das Leben der Geiseln war
immer noch in Gefahr.
""Die Geiseln sind noch im Kern von Shell 2,
nicht wahr?""
""Ja..."" Emma versuchte aufzustehen und
stolperte. Langsam kam sie auf die Beine.
""Sind Sie in Ordnung?"" fragte Snake.
""Ja, es geht... Übrigens haben mir die
Terroristen eine Spritze verpasst. Sie sollte
mich von der Flucht abhalten.Ich glaube, es
war eine Art Beruhigungsmittel... meine
Füße sind schwer wie Blei...""
Emma verlor wieder das Gleichgewicht.
Snake konnte sie im Fallen festhalten. Trotz
der Spritze konnte sie noch Informationen
vom Feind bekommen und verlor den Zweck
ihres Hierseins nie aus dem Blick. Diese
junge Frau war voller Überraschungen.
Wenigstens in dieser Hinsicht erinnerte sie
an ihren Stiefbruder.
""Das reicht. Sie sollten sich lieber irgendwo
verstecken.""
""Auf keinen Fall. Ich komme mit.""
""Aber...""
""Bitte nehmen Sie mich mit."" Ihre Blicke
trafen sich.
""Sie haben mir jetzt zweimal das Leben
gerettet. Ich möchte mich revanchieren,
wenn ich kann. Ich weiß, dass ich irgendwie
nützlich sein kann... Bitte!""
Schließlich gab Snake nach. Um zum Kern
von Shell 1 zu kommen, musste er die
Verbindungsbrücke zwischen Shell 1 und
Shell 2 von Strebe D her überqueren. Die
beiden machten sich auf den Weg zu Strebe
D.#C0

""Ja, es geht... Übrigens haben mir die
Terroristen eine Spritze verpasst. Sie sollte
mich von der Flucht abhalten.Ich glaube, es
war eine Art Beruhigungsmittel... meine
Füße sind schwer wie Blei...""
Emma verlor wieder das Gleichgewicht.
Snake konnte sie im Fallen festhalten. Trotz
der Spritze konnte sie noch Informationen
vom Feind bekommen und verlor den Zweck
ihres Hierseins nie aus dem Blick. Diese
junge Frau war voller Überraschungen.
Wenigstens in dieser Hinsicht erinnerte sie
an ihren Stiefbruder.
""Das reicht. Sie sollten sich lieber irgendwo
verstecken.""
""Auf keinen Fall. Ich komme mit.""
""Aber...""
""Bitte nehmen Sie mich mit."" Ihre Blicke
trafen sich.
""Sie haben mir jetzt zweimal das Leben
gerettet. Ich möchte mich revanchieren,
wenn ich kann. Ich weiß, dass ich irgendwie
nützlich sein kann... Bitte!""

von Shell 1 zu kommen, musste er die

Fluchtversuch getötet worden waren. Er fiel
in tiefe Verzweiflung und dachte sogar an
Selbstmord. Aber dann hatte er eine Vision.
Für seinen Tod war es noch zu früh. Nein,
er musste sich erst am Syndikat rächen. Er
wollte, dass sie mit Blut dafür zahlten, was
sie Frau und Kind angetan hatten.
Während des nächsten Jahrs entwarf er
einen erfinderischen Plan. Es sollte so
aussehen, als wäre er von einem
rivalisierenden Syndikat getötet worden, das
die Drogen stehlen wollte. Damit sollte ein
Krieg zwischen den zwei Syndikaten
beginnen, der mit der Zerstörung beider
enden würde. Zunächst täuschte er sein
eigenes Verschwinden vor. Kurz danach
erschlug er mit einem Kran den Mann, den
das Syndikat zu seiner Überwachung
geschickt hatte. Und kurz darauf warf er den
Mann über Bord ins Meer, den die Mafia
geschickt hatte, um die beiden Vorfälle zu
untersuchen. Wie er erwartet hatte, begann

Ultimamente c'era stata una serie di
infortuni mortali tra gli impiegati della Big
Shell. Circolavano diverse voci sulle cause
di queste morti: si aggirava un serial killer,
gli impiegati stavano andando fuori di testa,
l'intero posto era stregato. Da simbolo del
rispetto per l'ambiente, la Big Shell si era
trasformata in una fonte di guadagno per i
giornali scandalistici.
""Sono preoccupato per Emma. Vai a
controllare che stia bene per conto mio?""
Snake fece cenno di no con la mano.

Sei ore dopo, Snake si ritrovò sull'eliporto
della Big Shell. Guardava un gruppo di
uomini armati che iniziavano a invadere
l'impianto sotto i suoi occhi. Snake si
nascose dietro una cassa. Fu allora che
Otacon lo chiamò sul Codec.
""... Pensi che si tratti di terroristi?"" chiese.
""Che ne so. Ma è chiaro che la situazione è
un po' più pericolosa di prima. Complimenti.
A quanto pare, ci avevi visto giusto.""
""Non è affatto confortante. Spero che
Emma stia bene...""
""Già, pure io,"" disse Snake. Lo sguardo si
posò su un jet Harrier fermo sull'eliporto. ""E
quell'Harrier? È dei terroristi?""
""No, appartiene ai Marines. A quanto pare,
hanno eseguito un atterraggio d'emergenza
qui tre giorni fa, per un problema durante
un'esercitazione.""
Snake fece un cenno. ""Per prima cosa,
dobbiamo scoprire cosa sta succedendo qui.
Io entro.""
""Ricevuto. Fai attenzione. A proposito,
Snake...""
""Che c'è?""
""Se ti capita d'incontrare Emma, non fare il
mio nome, intesi?""
""Perché no?""
""Beh... è da tanto tempo che non ci
vediamo... e tutto a un tratto...""
Otacon esitò. Snake si rese conto che c'era
dell'altro oltre a ciò che Otacon gli aveva
raccontato, ma decise di non indagare
mentre si dirigeva dentro la Big Shell.#C0
","""Snake, devi farmi un favore,"" disse
Otacon.
Snake aggrottò la fronte. I ""favori"" di Otacon
significavano sempre guai, di solito per
Snake.
""Scordatelo. Non so cos'hai in mente
questa volta, ma sono stufo di correre in
giro per il Paese per una stupida crociata
che non capisco neanche.""
""Non si tratta di questo. Si tratta di... mia
sorella.""
""Tua sorella?""
""Esatto. Si chiama Emma."" D'improvviso,
Otacon si fece serio, e iniziò a raccontare la
storia. Di recente aveva scoperto dove si
trovava la sua sorella acquisita,
allontanatasi da tempo. Pare che lavorasse
come programmatrice di sistemi sulla ""Big
Shell"", un impianto di decontaminazione
marina nella baia di Manhattan.

Snake non riuscì a pensare cosa rispondere.
Emma sembrò un po' delusa.
""...O forse perché ho cambiato la password
del sistema di computer e li ho tagliati
fuori.""
""Sarebbe a dire?""
Emma spiegò che aveva visto i terroristi
tentare di usare il sistema di computer della
Big Shell per fare qualcosa. Grazie a un
diversivo, era riuscita a fuggire e a
modificare il sistema, di modo che non
potessero più usarlo. ""Così ho guadagnato
tempo, e ho pensato che ciò potesse irritarli
ancora di più.""
Probabilmente, era più preoccupata della
seconda cosa, pensò Snake. ""Cos'è che i
terroristi tentavano di fare con il sistema?""
""Come faccio a saperlo?""
""Ha qualcosa a che vedere con il 'fantasma

scemenza!"" Agitò le mani sopra la testa.

nell'ultimo mese. Che cosa triste! Due di
loro sono spariti all'improvviso, uno dopo
l'altro. Poi un altro non ha fatto in tempo a

impiegato, a cui era morto il figlio, che tentò
di suicidarsi, ma in realtà non morì, rimase
storpiato, o qualcosa del genere, e ora
terrorizza questo posto... insomma, quel
genere di cose.""
Per un attimo sembrò che ad Emma
tremasse lo sguardo, ma poi si riprese
rapidamente. La sua voce si fece di nuovo
allegra.
""Ehi, i posti come questo si prestano alle

""A quanto pare, hai imparato bene la
lezione.""
""Snake, sei sicuro che Emma non ti abbia
dato nient'altro?""
""Certo. Comunque, perché sono convinti
che ce l'abbia io?""
""... Forse Emma gli ha mentito.""
""O forse l'ha data al vero fantasma della
Big Shell.""
""È impossibile,"" tagliò corto Otacon.
""Come fai ad esserne tanto sicuro?""
ribatté Snake.
""Ehi, eri convinto che non esistesse un
fantasma, o sbaglio? Dobbiamo sbrigarci e
salvare Emma!""
""Hai ragione. Ma non sappiamo neanche
dove l'hanno portata...""
Sul Codec, Snake sentì Otacon battere una
mano contro l'altra.
""Ci sono! Perché non ci ho pensato
prima?""
""Cosa?""
""Emma ha detto di avere la sua tessera
personale, no? Le tessere di sicurezza
della Big Shell funzionano su un sistema
RFID d'identificazione a radiofrequenza.
Ogni tessera RFID è dotata di un chip di
memoria che invia dati tramite un
radiosegnale. I lettori di tessere usano
questi segnali per rilevare le identità nel
raggio di azione. Tutti i dati della Big Shell
convergono in un sistema di gestione
integrato, accessibile con una password di
livello 3!"" Ora Otacon parlava velocemente.
""...Sarebbe a dire?"" chiese Snake.
""Vuol dire che puoi usare il nodo per
scovare in quale supporto si trova Emma!
Snake, tenta di nuovo di accedere al nodo
con quella password.""
Snake fece come aveva detto Otacon. Poco
dopo sullo schermo un punto lampeggiava
nel Supporto F.
""È lei. Si trova nel Supporto F. Snake, devi
fare in fretta!""#C0
","Snake accedette al nodo, immise la
password datagli da Emma e, poco dopo,
sul monitor comparve un messaggio che
diceva che la porta per il ponte di
collegamento tra Shell 1 e Shell 2 era stata
sbloccata. Non appena Snake si voltò
nuovamente verso il Supporto C, sentì una
voce provenire da un altoparlante nascosto.
Probabilmente veniva diramato in tutto
l'impianto.
""Questo è un messaggio per il fantasma
della Big Shell. Hai l'ordine di sbloccare
immediatamente il sistema usando la chiave
di controllo che hai preso alla ragazza. Hai
15 minuti di tempo. Obbedisci, o uccideremo
la ragazza. Ripeto...""
La voce ripeté l'avvertimento. A Snake
vennero i brividi. La ragazza di cui
parlavano doveva essere Emma. L'avevano
catturata davvero? E cos'era la chiave di
controllo di cui parlavano? Snake contattò
Otacon tramite il Codec.
""Hanno preso Emma?!"" esplose Otacon.
""Cos'hai...""
""Ti vuoi calmare? Sto tentando di
escogitare un piano per salvarla.""
Otacon riprese a parlare con calma.
""D'accordo.""
""La chiave di controllo di cui parlano,
potrebbe essere la tessera che mi ha dato
Emma?""
""No, quella è una tessera di sicurezza,
serve solo per aprire le porte. La chiave di
controllo sembra più... una chiave a cui ha
accesso l'unico amministratore del sistema
della Big Shell. Funge da dispositivo di
verifica. In poche parole, non puoi
modificare il sistema di computer della Big
Shell senza la chiave. I terroristi ne hanno
bisogno per accedere al sistema...""
""E se usassero una password, come ho
fatto io?""
""Non funzionerebbe. Le password sono utili
solo fino al livello di sicurezza 3. Per
accedere agli altri, serve la chiave di
controllo...""
""A quanto pare, hai imparato bene la
lezione.""
""Snake, sei sicuro che Emma non ti abbia

""Di che si tratta?""
""Droga!""
Emma riferì la storia che aveva sentito da
una delle guardie quando era stata
catturata.
Il gruppo armato che aveva assunto il
controllo della Big Shell apparteneva a
un'organizzazione criminale russa. Con
l'aiuto di alcuni impiegati dell'impianto,
usavano la Big Shell come punto d'appoggio
per contrabbandare la droga. Di notte
prelevavano la droga da navi di
contrabbando a largo, la scaricavano nella
Big Shell per mezzo di piccole barche,
quindi la nascondevano con il carico in
uscita dalla Big Shell, per distribuirla nel
Paese. Negli ultimi anni erano aumentati i
controlli nel porto, e questo era un modo
conveniente ed efficace per smistare le
merci senza farsi scoprire.
Un mese prima, avevano caricato 600 kg di
droga per un valore di oltre 7 milioni di
dollari. Il giorno dopo, due degli impiegati
che lavoravano per l'organizzazione
morirono uno di seguito all'altro.
L'organizzazione inviò immediatamente uno
dei suoi uomini a fare indagini, ma anche lui
ci lasciò la pelle poco dopo il suo arrivo.
I dirigenti dell'organizzazione decisero che
quegli incidenti erano stati causati da
un'organizzazione rivale, in competizione nel
commercio della droga, e ora tentavano di
impossessarsi del loro carico. Così
mandarono le loro truppe per recuperare la
droga, e si arrivò alla situazione attuale.
""Dunque il 'fantasma della Big Shell' è...""
Con un'espressione maliziosa, Emma
replicò: ""Esatto. Non è affatto un fantasma.
È un semplice vecchio cecchino mandato
dall'organizzazione rivale per rubare la
droga.""
""... E tu gli hai detto che sono io il
cecchino.""
""Beh, sì... Ma ormai quel che è fatto è
fatto, no? Non stiamo qui a discuterne.""
Snake decise di non indagare ulteriormente
e cambiò argomento. ""Dove possono avere
nascosto quell'ingente quantitativo di droga
nella Big Shell?""
""Non ne ho idea. Non avevo idea di cosa
stesse succedendo. Figurati che stento
ancora a crederci...""
Anche Snake era confuso. Com'era possibile
che alcuni impiegati tenessero nascosti nella
Big Shell centinaia di chili di droga senza
che gli altri li scovassero? In ogni caso,
non poteva permettersi di sprecare più
tempo a pensarci su. Le vite degli ostaggi
erano ancora in pericolo.
""Gli ostaggi sono ancora nel centro di
Shell 2, non è così?""
""Già..."" Emma provò a tirarsi su,
barcollando. Lentamente, si rimise in piedi.
""Va tutto bene?"" le chiese Snake.
""Sì, sto bene... A dire il vero, i terroristi mi
hanno iniettato qualcosa. Hanno detto che
era per impedirmi di fuggire. Sarà stato un
sedativo... ora mi sento come se i miei piedi
pesassero due tonnellate...""
Emma perse di nuovo l'equilibrio. Snake
l'afferrò mentre cadeva. Anche sotto l'effetto
dei sedativi, era riuscita a ricavare
informazioni dal nemico e non aveva mai
scordato il motivo per cui si trovava lì.
Quella ragazza era una scoperta continua.
Almeno in questo, somigliava al fratello
acquisito.
""Basta così. Faresti meglio a trovarti un
nascondiglio.""
""Neanche per sogno. Io vengo con te.""
""Ma...""
""Ti prego, portami con te."" Gli occhi di
Emma parlavano chiaro.
""Mi hai già salvato la vita due volte. Ora
voglio restituirti il favore, se posso. So di
poterti essere utile... Ti prego!""

che ti sarei stata utile?""
""Devo ammettere che te la sei cavata bene
là,"" disse Snake annuendo. Si ricordò di
come Emma si fosse collegata al nodo con il
suo palmare. ""A proposito, non stavi
scaricando qualcosa dal nodo?""
""Sì. Te ne sei accorto?"" Emma tirò fuori il
palmare. ""Mentre attivavo il nastro
trasportatore, ho trovato un file nascosto
sospetto accanto al file di controllo del
nastro. Così ho deciso di scaricarlo, ed ecco
cosa ho trovato...""
Sullo schermo del palmare era visualizzato il
file. Sembrava una specie di appunto scritto
da uno dei due impiegati rimasti uccisi,
quelli che avevano aiutato l'organizzazione a
introdurre la droga nella Big Shell. Nel file
spiegava che stava collaborando con i Russi
solo perché tenevano in ostaggio sua moglie
e suo figlio. Ma l'anno scorso aveva
scoperto che erano già stati uccisi, nel
tentativo di fuggire. Disperato, era arrivato
al punto di meditare il suicidio. Ma poi ebbe
come un'illuminazione: non era ancora
arrivato per lui il momento di morire. No,
doveva prima vendicarsi dell'organizzazione:
avrebbero pagato con il sangue ciò che
avevano fatto a sua moglie e a suo figlio.
Nell'anno successivo, preparò un piano
ingegnoso: avrebbe fatto credere di essere
stato ucciso da un'organizzazione rivale che
tentava di rubare la droga, così avrebbe
scatenato la guerra tra le due
organizzazioni, che si sarebbero distrutte a
vicenda. Prima inscenò la sua scomparsa.
Poco dopo usò una gru per schiacciare e
uccidere l'uomo mandato dall'organizzazione
a controllarlo, dopo di che fece cadere in
mare l'uomo inviato dalla Mafia a fare
indagini sulle due morti. Come previsto, era
scoppiata una guerra tra le due
organizzazioni rivali. Tutto filava a
meraviglia. Ormai poteva riposare in pace.
Diceva che presto avrebbe raggiunto sua
moglie e suo figlio. Infine, implorava la
persona che leggeva il file di dire una
preghiera per la moglie e il figlio morti. Così
finiva il file. Era datato tre giorni prima.
Snake alzò gli occhi dal palmare. ""...
Significa che il fantasma della Big Shell è
morto?""
Emma non riuscì a nascondere l'emozione.
""Forse... Veramente, ho scaricato pure un
altro file...""
Snake riuscì a sentire un suono sommesso
di qualcosa che volava in aria.
Immediatamente, afferrò Emma e la strinse
a sé. Ci fu un'esplosione. La violenza dello
scoppio fece cadere Snake ed Emma.
""Cos'è stato?"" gemette Emma tra le
braccia di Snake.
Una forte raffica di vento li colpì al viso.
Sospeso sopra il ponte, al di là del punto in
cui era avvenuta l'esplosione, c'era l'Harrier.
""A quanto pare, ESISTEVA qualcosa che
poteva farli uscire dal Supporto E...""
mormorò Emma, chiaramente sgomenta.
L'Harrier prese a mitragliare il ponte senza
interruzione. Snake ed Emma fuggirono
tornando all'entrata del Supporto D.
""Adesso che facciamo?""
""Penso che dovrò abbatterlo.""
""E come?""
""Penserò a qualcosa.""
""Parli sul serio?!"" protestò Emma; ma
prima che riuscisse a finire, Snake la spinse
oltre la porta del Supporto D.
""Che stai facendo?"" domandò.
""Resta lì! Qualunque cosa accada, non
uscire qua fuori!""
""Ma...!""
""Vuoi ascoltarmi per una volta?"" Snake le
sorrise. ""Ho già promesso a qualcuno che ti
avrei riportata con me.""
""Che...""
La porta si richiuse sbattendo.
Snake sentì il rumore di un elicottero in
avvicinamento. Era Otacon con il suo
Kasatka.
""Snake, usa questi!""
Dall'abitacolo, Otacon gli lanciò una scatola.

palmare. ""Mentre attivavo il nastro
trasportatore, ho trovato un file nascosto
sospetto accanto al file di controllo del
nastro. Così ho deciso di scaricarlo, ed ecco
cosa ho trovato...""
Sullo schermo del palmare era visualizzato il
file. Sembrava una specie di appunto scritto
da uno dei due impiegati rimasti uccisi,
quelli che avevano aiutato l'organizzazione a
introdurre la droga nella Big Shell. Nel file
spiegava che stava collaborando con i Russi
solo perché tenevano in ostaggio sua moglie
e suo figlio. Ma l'anno scorso aveva
scoperto che erano già stati uccisi, nel
tentativo di fuggire. Disperato, era arrivato
al punto di meditare il suicidio. Ma poi ebbe
come un'illuminazione: non era ancora
arrivato per lui il momento di morire. No,
doveva prima vendicarsi dell'organizzazione:
avrebbero pagato con il sangue ciò che
avevano fatto a sua moglie e a suo figlio.
Nell'anno successivo, preparò un piano
ingegnoso: avrebbe fatto credere di essere
stato ucciso da un'organizzazione rivale che
tentava di rubare la droga, così avrebbe
scatenato la guerra tra le due
organizzazioni, che si sarebbero distrutte a
vicenda. Prima inscenò la sua scomparsa.
Poco dopo usò una gru per schiacciare e
uccidere l'uomo mandato dall'organizzazione
a controllarlo, dopo di che fece cadere in
mare l'uomo inviato dalla Mafia a fare
indagini sulle due morti. Come previsto, era
scoppiata una guerra tra le due
organizzazioni rivali. Tutto filava a
meraviglia. Ormai poteva riposare in pace.
Diceva che presto avrebbe raggiunto sua
moglie e suo figlio. Infine, implorava la
persona che leggeva il file di dire una
preghiera per la moglie e il figlio morti. Così
finiva il file. Era datato tre giorni prima.
Snake alzò gli occhi dal palmare. ""...
Significa che il fantasma della Big Shell è
morto?""
Emma non riuscì a nascondere l'emozione.
""Forse... Veramente, ho scaricato pure un
altro file...""
Snake riuscì a sentire un suono sommesso
di qualcosa che volava in aria.
Immediatamente, afferrò Emma e la strinse
a sé. Ci fu un'esplosione. La violenza dello
scoppio fece cadere Snake ed Emma.
""Cos'è stato?"" gemette Emma tra le
braccia di Snake.
Una forte raffica di vento li colpì al viso.
Sospeso sopra il ponte, al di là del punto in
cui era avvenuta l'esplosione, c'era l'Harrier.
""A quanto pare, ESISTEVA qualcosa che
poteva farli uscire dal Supporto E...""
mormorò Emma, chiaramente sgomenta.
L'Harrier prese a mitragliare il ponte senza
interruzione. Snake ed Emma fuggirono
tornando all'entrata del Supporto D.
""Adesso che facciamo?""
""Penso che dovrò abbatterlo.""
""E come?""
""Penserò a qualcosa.""
""Parli sul serio?!"" protestò Emma; ma
prima che riuscisse a finire, Snake la spinse
oltre la porta del Supporto D.
""Che stai facendo?"" domandò.
""Resta lì! Qualunque cosa accada, non
uscire qua fuori!""
""Ma...!""
""Vuoi ascoltarmi per una volta?"" Snake le
sorrise. ""Ho già promesso a qualcuno che ti
avrei riportata con me.""
""Che...""
La porta si richiuse sbattendo.
Snake sentì il rumore di un elicottero in
avvicinamento. Era Otacon con il suo
Kasatka.
""Snake, usa questi!""
Dall'abitacolo, Otacon gli lanciò una scatola.
Erano missili Stinger. Con questi, avrebbe
combattuto ad armi pari. Snake si voltò e si
preparò per la battaglia contro l'Harrier.#C0

precipitare al suolo, si aprì la porta del
Supporto D. Emma sbirciò fuori con cautela.
Sembrava che avesse pianto.
""È finita.""
""Come mai ci hai messo tanto?""
""Scusa.""
""Stai bene? Sei ferito, per caso?""
""Sto bene, davvero.""
Snake ed Emma liberarono gli impiegati
della Big Shell, presi in ostaggio, e con la
radio della Big Shell chiamarono la polizia. I
poliziotti sarebbero arrivati presto. I terroristi
erano ancora intrappolati nel Supporto E.
Snake ed Emma decisero di andare
all'eliporto sul Supporto I, in attesa dei
rinforzi.
""A proposito, Emma, prima non stavi
dicendo qualcosa a proposito di un secondo
file?""
""Ah, sì. Sono riuscita ad accedere alle

razón, pensó Snake para sus adentros. ""¿Y
qué están intentando hacer los terroristas
en el ordenador?""
""¿Y yo cómo lo voy a saber?""
""¿Tiene algo que ver con el ""fantasma del
Big Shell""?""
""¿De qué estás hablando?"" Emma fingió
que estaba sorprendida.
""Ellos dijeron que algunos de sus
camaradas fueron asesinados por el
""fantasma del Big Shell"". ¿Quién es ese
""fantasma"" del que hablan?""
Emma miró a Snake con cara de asco.
""¿Por qué me estás mirando así?""
""¿El ""fantasma del Big Shell""? ¡Qué
explicación más pobre!"" Movió la mano por
encima de su cabeza. ""Sí, es verdad que
tres de ellos murieron el mes pasado. En
realidad fue muy triste. Dos de ellos,
desaparecieron así, uno detrás del otro. Y
luego este otro tío que acababa de llegar,
también desapareció... Pero fueron
accidentes, ¿vale? Lo que pasa es que
ahora dicen que es por no sé qué
leyenda...""
""¿Leyenda? ¿Así que la historia del
""fantasma"" ya lleva tiempo en circulación?""
""Sí. Cuentan que hace ya mucho tiempo
hubo un trabajador cuyo hijo murió, luego el
intentó quitarse la vida, pero en realidad no
murió, pero acabó echo polvo, y ahora vaga
por este lugar... ya ves, la historia de
siempre.""
Los ojos de Emma parecieron parpadear por
un minuto, pero rápidamente volvió a la
normalidad. Su voz de nuevo era muy
alegre y dicharachera.
""Oye, siempre asocian uno o dos
fantasmas con este tipo de lugares, ¿no?
Hay gente que dice que ha visto sombras
vagando por habitaciones, que en teoría,
estaban vacías. Pero personalmente creo
que probablemente era alguien que se
estaba escaqueando, ya sabes, para no
trabajar...""
""Pero...""
""¡Venga, los fantasmas no existen!"" No
había duda de que Emma se estaba
poniendo nerviosa.
""Vale, vale, tranquilízate. Yo tampoco creo
en las historias de fantasmas.""
""¡Ya! Son estupideces, ¿verdad?"" Emma
parecía aliviada.
""Verdad. Pero no quiero descartar ninguna
posibilidad. ¿Crees que alguien ha podido
entrar sin autorización?""
Emma pensó durante un minuto. ""El Big
Shell está automatizado prácticamente en
su totalidad, así que muchos lugares son
inaccesibles a cualquier humano. Pero sí,
creo que puede ser posible. Pero...""
De repente, la puerta del Comedor se abrió.
Guardias enemigos comenzaron a entrar a
la habitación, gritaban enfadados. Habían
estado demasiado tiempo hablando. Snake
gruñó frustrado. Resultaba difícil
concentrarse estando al lado de Emma.
""¡Emma! ¡Agáchate!"" Gritó Snake al
mismo tiempo que sacaba su USP.#C0
","Snake se aproximó lentamente hacia la
chica, que se arrinconó contra la esquina de
la despensa.
""Eres Emma, ¿verdad?""
""¿Tú quién eres? ¡¿Cómo sabes mi
nombre?!""
""Tranquilízate,"" dijo Snake intentando
tranquilizarla. ""Estoy en tu bando. ¡He
venido a rescatarte!""
""¿Estás en mi... bando?""
""Así es.""
""¿Has venido a salvarme?""
""Sí.""
""¿De verdad?""
""De verdad.""
Emma miró a Snake con cierta sospecha.
""¿Qué pasa, no parezco de fiar?"" dijo
Snake.
""Qué te pasa, ¿en tu casa no hay
espejos?""
Snake iba a contestarla, pero Emma le
interrumpió.
""Da lo mismo. Bueno, ¿y por qué has
venido a rescatarme exactamente?""
Snake recordó lo que le había dicho Otacon
? pase lo que pase, no debo mencionar su
nombre.
""No te lo puedo decir.""
""¿Por qué no?""
""Porque no puedo.""
Emma miró a Snake de arriba a abajo, de la
cabeza a los pies. No parecía muy
convencida, pero al menos bajó la guardia.
""Sabes, no eres un héroe muy convincente.
Pero tampoco pareces un tío malo. ¿Cómo
te llamas?""
""Solid Snake.""
De golpe, Emma se levantó y agarró a
Snake por la oreja.
""¿Holaaa? Do you speak Spanish? Te he
preguntado cuál es tu NOMBRE no tu
APODO. Dios, ¡qué tío!"" Emma soltó la
oreja de Snake y le miró fijamente a los
ojos. ""¿Cuál es tu VERDADERO nombre?""
""Me deshice de él.""
""¿Eh?""
""La gente en mi línea de trabajo no tiene
nombre.""
Emma frunció el ceño. ""Mmm. Puede que
no seas un tío malo, pero raro, eres super
raro. Pero me da igual. Así que... ¿Solid?""
""Llámame Snake."" Snake suspiró. Menudo
trabajo estaba resultando hablar con esta
niña.
""Tío, menuda obsesión que tienes con los
nombres. Pues vale, SNAKE, tú eres...""
Snake la interrumpió. ""Deja que te haga
unas preguntas, ¿vale?""
""... Vale, de acuerdo.""
""¿Por qué te están buscando esos
terroristas?""
""Será porque me encuentran
irresistiblemente atractiva.""
A Snake no se le ocurrió nada que decir.
Emma parecía decepcionada.
""... O también puede ser porque he
cambiado la clave del ordenador y les he
bloqueado el acceso.""
""¿Qué quieres decir?""
Emma se lo explicó. Vio como los terroristas
intentaban usar la red de ordenadores del
Big Shell para hacer algo que ella
desconocía. Y luego, tras encontrar una
forma de escapar, cambió algo en el
sistema para que no lo pudieran utilizar.
""Así gané algo de tiempo y además, seguro
que también conseguí que se cabrearan.""
Probablemente ella lo hizo por la segunda
razón, pensó Snake para sus adentros. ""¿Y

""¿Qué buscan?""
""¡Drogas!""
Emma le contó una historia que había
escuchado relatar a uno de los guardias
cuando había estado capturada.
El grupo armado que tomó el Big Shell
pertenecía a un grupo mafioso ruso. Con la
ayuda de varios empleados de la planta, el
grupo mafioso estaba utilizando el Big Shell
como centro de operaciones para el
contrabando de drogas. Durante la noche,
transportaban las drogas en pequeños botes
desde barcos contrabandistas, hasta el Big
Shell. Y luego metían las drogas en el cargo
del Big Shell y de esta forma las introducían
en el país. La seguridad en el puerto se
había reforzado en los últimos años, y ésta
era una forma fácil y efectiva de introducir
las drogas sin ser descubiertos. Hace un
mes, consiguieron introducir un cargamento
de 600 kilos de drogas, de un valor de venta
de 7 millones de dólares. Al día siguiente,
dos de los empleados del Big Shell que
colaboraban con el grupo mafioso murieron
en ""accidentes"". El grupo mafioso mandó a
uno de sus hombres para investigar lo que
había ocurrido, pero ese hombre también
murió víctima de un ""accidente"" al poco
tiempo de llegar.
Los líderes del grupo mafioso llegaron a la
conclusión de que estos ""accidentes"" habían
sido obra de otro grupo mafioso que
también se dedicaba al contrabando de
drogas, y que estaba intentando tomar el
barco para su propio uso. Por eso enviaron
a sus tropas, para recuperar las drogas. Y
por eso ahora se encontraban en esta
situación.  ""Así que el ""fantasma del Big
Shell"" es...""
Una sonrisa picarona se apoderó del rostro
de Emma. ""Exacto. No es un fantasma. Es
un sicario normal y corriente que ha sido
enviado por el otro grupo mafioso, para que
robe las drogas.""
""... Y tú les has dicho que yo soy ese
sicario.""
""Bueno... sí. Pero a lo hecho pecho, ¿no?
De poco vale discutir eso ahora.""
Snake decidió dejarlo ahí. Cambió de tema.
""¿Y dónde crees que pueden esconder tal
cantidad de drogas en el Big Shell?""
""No tengo ni idea. No sabía lo que estaba
ocurriendo. Todavía me cuesta creerlo...""
También Snake estaba intrigado. ¿Cómo era
posible que unos pocos empleados
estuvieran escondiendo cientos de kilos de
drogas sin que ningún otro empleado se
diera cuenta? Pero no podía perder más
tiempo dándole vueltas a esto. La vida de
los rehenes todavía corría peligro.
""Los rehenes todavía siguen en el núcleo
del Shell 2, ¿no?""  ""Sí..."" Emma intentó
levantarse y dio un traspié. Lentamente,
tambaleándose, consiguió ponerse de pie.
""¿Estás bien?"" preguntó Snake.
""Sí, estoy bien... Ahora que lo pienso, los
terroristas me inyectaron algo. Dijeron que
así no me podría volver a escapar. Creo que
era un tranquilizante... y ahora me parece
que los pies me pesan muchísimo...""
Emma comenzó a tambalearse de nuevo.
Snake la sujetó cuando estaba a punto de
caerse. Había conseguido sacarles
información a los terroristas, incluso en el
estado en el que se encontraba. Esta chica
estaba llena de sorpresas. Al menos en
esto, se parecía mucho a su hermanastro.
""No estás bien. Será mejor que te
escondas en algún lugar.""
""Ni soñarlo. Voy contigo.""
""Pero...""
""Por favor, déjame ir contigo."" Emma le
miró a Snake directamente a los ojos.
""Ya me has salvado la vida dos veces.
Quiero devolverte el favor. Sé que te podré
ser de ayuda de alguna forma... ¡Por
favor!"" Al final Snake accedió. Para llegar
al núcleo del Shell 1, tendría que cruzar el
puente de conexión entre el Shell 1 y el
Shell 2 desde el Soporte D. Los dos se
dirigieron al Soporte D.#C0

en ""accidentes"". El grupo mafioso mandó a
uno de sus hombres para investigar lo que
había ocurrido, pero ese hombre también
murió víctima de un ""accidente"" al poco
tiempo de llegar.
Los líderes del grupo mafioso llegaron a la
conclusión de que estos ""accidentes"" habían
sido obra de otro grupo mafioso que
también se dedicaba al contrabando de
drogas, y que estaba intentando tomar el
barco para su propio uso. Por eso enviaron
a sus tropas, para recuperar las drogas. Y
por eso ahora se encontraban en esta
situación.  ""Así que el ""fantasma del Big
Shell"" es...""
Una sonrisa picarona se apoderó del rostro
de Emma. ""Exacto. No es un fantasma. Es
un sicario normal y corriente que ha sido
enviado por el otro grupo mafioso, para que
robe las drogas.""
""... Y tú les has dicho que yo soy ese
sicario.""
""Bueno... sí. Pero a lo hecho pecho, ¿no?
De poco vale discutir eso ahora.""
Snake decidió dejarlo ahí. Cambió de tema.
""¿Y dónde crees que pueden esconder tal
cantidad de drogas en el Big Shell?""
""No tengo ni idea. No sabía lo que estaba
ocurriendo. Todavía me cuesta creerlo...""
También Snake estaba intrigado. ¿Cómo era
posible que unos pocos empleados
estuvieran escondiendo cientos de kilos de
drogas sin que ningún otro empleado se
diera cuenta? Pero no podía perder más
tiempo dándole vueltas a esto. La vida de
los rehenes todavía corría peligro.
""Los rehenes todavía siguen en el núcleo
del Shell 2, ¿no?""  ""Sí..."" Emma intentó
levantarse y dio un traspié. Lentamente,
tambaleándose, consiguió ponerse de pie.
""¿Estás bien?"" preguntó Snake.
""Sí, estoy bien... Ahora que lo pienso, los
terroristas me inyectaron algo. Dijeron que
así no me podría volver a escapar. Creo que
era un tranquilizante... y ahora me parece
que los pies me pesan muchísimo...""
Emma comenzó a tambalearse de nuevo.
Snake la sujetó cuando estaba a punto de
caerse. Había conseguido sacarles
información a los terroristas, incluso en el
estado en el que se encontraba. Esta chica
estaba llena de sorpresas. Al menos en
esto, se parecía mucho a su hermanastro.
""No estás bien. Será mejor que te
escondas en algún lugar.""
""Ni soñarlo. Voy contigo.""
""Pero...""
""Por favor, déjame ir contigo."" Emma le
miró a Snake directamente a los ojos.
""Ya me has salvado la vida dos veces.
Quiero devolverte el favor. Sé que te podré
ser de ayuda de alguna forma... ¡Por
favor!"" Al final Snake accedió. Para llegar
al núcleo del Shell 1, tendría que cruzar el
puente de conexión entre el Shell 1 y el
Shell 2 desde el Soporte D. Los dos se
dirigieron al Soporte D.#C0

se dirigió hacia el nodo y comenzó a
teclear.
""Cómo...""
""Espera y verás.""
Un segundo más tarde, de la cinta
transportadora salió una caja. Emma la
abrió. Estaba repleta de bolsas de plástico
llenas de polvo blanco.
""El grupo mafioso sabía que si escondían
todas las drogas en el mismo lugar, seguro
que tarde o temprano, alguien las iba a
descubrir,"" dijo Emma mientras observaban
más cajas apareciendo por la cinta
transportadora. ""Así que escondieron las
drogas en estas cajas y las guardaron, de

era esta chica. Observó como Emma
sacaba su PDA (agenda electrónica
personal) y la conectaba al nodo.
""¿Y ahora qué estás haciendo?"" dijo.
""Mmm. Creo que he encontrado algo
interesante aquí... tiene que ser...""

de los terroristas. En cuanto vio a Snake y
a Emma, echó a correr. Snake corrió tras el
terrorista, pero Emma le agarró la mano.

empezó a teclear en el nodo a gran
velocidad.

""Si nos vamos ahora, vendrán por
nosotros. Así que...""
En cuestión de segundos, Snake pudo
escuchar el sonido de un grupo que se
aproximaba a la puerta. Pisadas, voces que
daban órdenes, el sonido de rifles al
montarse. Derribarían la puerta en cualquier
momento. Pero Emma, sin embargo, seguía
enganchada a la pantalla del nodo.
""¡Emma!"" gritó Snake.
Por fin se alejó del nodo. ""Ya está, creo que

idea del suicidio. Pero entonces, se le
ocurrió algo. Todavía no había llegado su

les habían hecho a su mujer y a su hijo.
Se pasó el siguiente año ingeniando un plan
perfecto. Haría parecer que había sido

mafioso rival que estaba intentando robar
las drogas. Esto iniciaría una guerra entre
ambas mafias, y acabarían destruyéndose la
una a la otra. Primero, haría como que
había desaparecido. Después, utilizaría una

de que pudiera matarte?""  ""No estoy
segura... sí, puede ser.""
""Y entonces, ¿por qué dejaron allí el
archivo?""
Emma se quedó pensativa durante un rato.
""Igual todo esto es una gran trampa. ¿Si no
por qué iban a poner ese informe en un
lugar tan evidente? Parece que querían que
lo encontráramos...""
Los dos, Snake y Emma, estaban muy
pensativos. El informe parecía realmente
auténtico, teniendo en cuenta la gran
cantidad de detalles que había en él. Pero si
el informe era real, entonces ¿quién estaba
matando a los empleados que estaban
trabajando para la mafia? ¿Quién había
olvidado el archivo y lo había dejado en el
sistema de ordenadores?
Finalmente Emma murmuró en voz muy
baja. ""Una vez oí algo... sobre el fantasma
del Big Shell... decían que su hijo había
muerto por sobredosis...""
Emma le contó a Snake lo que creía que
estaba sucediendo. Uno de los empleados,
devastado por la muerte de su hijo, había
planeado cometer suicidio. Pero no lo
consiguió, y desde entonces vagaba por el
Big Shell como un espectro de su antiguo
ser. Se creía que todavía vagaba por el Big
Shell, y que seguía sintiendo un gran odio
hacia las drogas y hacia la gente que
traficada con ellas. Un día, descubrió que
alguien estaba traficando con drogas en el
Big Shell...
""Pero nadie creería una historia como ésa,
¿verdad?"" Emma intentó sonreír, pero lo
único que consiguió fue mover un poco la
comisura de sus labios.#C0

in torrential sheets upon the churning, 
undulating surface of the river. A 
single, lonely rubber boat, painted jet 
black, was being tossed back and forth 
upon the waves like the plaything of 
some capricious river god. Snake lifted 
his face to peer over the edge of the 
boat. Over the din of the storm, he 
could hear the sound of helicopters. 
At length, he saw three black choppers 
approach the tanker in front of him. 
""Am I late?"" muttered Snake to 
himself.

Three days earlier, Campbell had 
visited Snake at his home in Alaska. 
Unlike Snake, who had gone back into 
retirement after the Shadow Moses 
incident, Campbell had gotten himself a 
position at the Defense Intelligence 
Agency. Snake had known right away 
that Campbell wasn't there to rekindle 
old ties with his former comrade.
After making some brief small talk, 
Campbell had jumped straight to the 
point.
""Do you remember a man by the name 
of Sergei Gurlukovich?""
Snake nodded. A former GRU colonel, 
Gurlukovich was known as a ruthless, 
cold-blooded strategist. During the Cold 
War, when Campbell was the 
commander of FOXHOUND, 
Gurlukovich had humiliated him on 
numerous occasions. After the collapse 
of the Soviet Union, he had organized 
a group of former Red Army soldiers 
into his own personal mercenary army. 
Since then, Gurlukovich and his troops 
had drifted from one war zone to the 
next, selling their services to the 
highest bidder.
""We received a report that Gurlukovich 
and his men attacked a group of 
Marines who were on a secret mission 
in the South American republic of 
Eldera. The Marines are being 
tight-lipped about it -- as usual, they'd 
rather keep a lid on the whole affair.
But from what we've been able to tell, 
it sounds like Metal Gear is involved.""
""Metal Gear?"" Snake growled. He'd 
heard the rumors, too. Following the 
Shadow Moses incident, the technical 
specs for Metal Gear had been leaked 
onto the black market. As a result, 
bastardized versions of Metal Gear 
were starting to crop up all over the 
world. Eldera was a small country in 
South America that happened to be 
engaged in a civil war. Since the 
1980's, the country had been under 
the control of a pro-American 
dictatorial regime. But as the Cold War 
drew to a close and American influence 
in the region declined, the country's 
minority ethnic population had taken up 
arms against the government, calling 
for the establishment of a separate 
homeland. The country had been torn 
apart by civil war ever since.
Mercenaries and arms merchants were 
constantly coming and going in and out 
of Eldera. Given those circumstances, 
Campbell had figured, it wouldn't be 
too surprising if one side or the other 
had managed to get their hands on a 
new type of Metal Gear. It seemed that 
some people still clung to the belief 
that the threat of nuclear war could 
bring stability to the region.
""And the Marines were there to try and 
destroy it?"" asked Snake.
""No. It looks as if they were trying to 
seize it for themselves. There's still a 
lot we don't know about the true nature 
of the new Metal Gear. This would 
have been a good chance to pick up a 
lot of valuable information.""
In other words, Eldera had managed to 
get itself a new type of Metal Gear, the 
Marines were plotting to seize it, and 
Gurlukovich was planning to steal it 
from the Marines. And now Campbell 
was proposing to go after Gurlukovich.
Snake shook his head. ""Sorry, but 
you'll have to find someone else to do 
your dirty work this time. I'm out of the 
hero business.""
""Snake....""
""Times are changing, Colonel. I think 
it's about time you gave it a rest.""
""You mean retire from the military?""
""No, I mean time to stop this damn 
vendetta of yours against Gurlukovich.""
The look of fury on Campbell's face 
confirmed Snake's suspicions. 
Campbell still hated Gurlukovich with a 
passion. It was an old grudge left over 
from the Cold War. The passage of 
time had done nothing to diminish it. 
Rather, it had grown in intensity.
""Is that why you joined the DIA? To 
settle old scores?""
""...Yes, you're right. But I didn't come 
all the way here to ask for your help 
just for the sake of a personal grudge."" 
Campbell's hands clenched into fists.
""...The truth is... Meryl was part of that 
mission.""

The rubber boat drew up alongside the 
tanker. Snake gripped the rope tightly.
Meryl Silverburg. Campbell's niece. 
The woman who had risked her life 
alongside Snake on Shadow Moses. 
At one time they'd been living together. 
Then, six months earlier, Meryl had left 
him. She said there was something 
important that she had to take care of. 
Her voice was resolute. Her eyes were 
clear and cold as steel. There was 
nothing Snake could do to stop her.

Snake climbed the rope up the outer 
hull of the tanker and emerged onto 
the aft deck. Nearby, he could see a 
number of soldiers standing guard. 
They appeared to be Russian 
mercenaries. He called Campbell on 
the Codec.
""This is Snake. I've managed to 
infiltrate the tanker. It looks like our 
Russian friends have already taken 
control of the ship. I'll try to get in 
touch with Meryl somehow.""#C0

Snake.

Snake nodded. He explained that 
Campbell had gotten word of 
Gurlukovich's attack.
""You've got a lot of nerve coming 
here!"" Meryl snapped.
""Look who's talking,"" Snake shot back.
""What?!""
""Sneaking into another country under 
the guise of a military operation when 
all you're really after is the Metal Gear. 
Who's got a lot of nerve coming here?""
His voice took on a condemnatory tone.
""Is this that 'something important' that 
you had to take care of?""
""...You wouldn't understand."" Meryl 
turned away. ""Someone like you, who 
could happily spend the rest of his life

""I was only trying to live my life free of 
hatred.""
""No. You just didn't want to face up to

""...Is that why you left?""
""No, that's not it...."" But the look in 
Meryl's eyes told Snake that it might 
well have been. A deep silence fell 
between them. Six months of 
separation had created a cold, empty 
gap that was difficult to fill. At last, 
Meryl broke the silence.
""...My father... he died here, in this 
country,"" she murmured.
Matt Campbell, Meryl's father and 
Campbell's younger brother, had been 
a DIA agent. Snake had heard that 
he'd disappeared during a mission 
when Meryl was very young.
""I wanted to see for myself what my 
father saw...."" Meryl's eyes drifted over 
to the window, but the only sight was 
that of the storm raging outside. She 
suddenly turned back to Snake and 
held him firmly in her gaze.
""Snake, please just get out of here. 
This is my battlefield. I don't need 
anyone from the outside to get involved 
in this.""
""It's a little too late for that. I'm already 
involved.""
""Nothing can change your mind?""
""Nothing,"" Snake said firmly.
Meryl sighed in exasperation. Snake 
pretended not to notice.
""Now tell me what our situation is. This 
mission was supposed to be top-secret, 
right? So how did Gurlukovich find out 
about it?""
""That's what I'd like to know, too.""
""You think there's a leak?""
""I doubt it. But seeing as how you 
know all about it, then I suppose 
anyone might know about it.""
Snake thought for a minute. Meryl was 
right -- anyone might know. But 
whatever the case, might be, they had 
to stop Gurlukovich from getting his 
hands on the Metal Gear.
""Where's the Metal Gear?""
""In the cargo hold.""
""All right. I'll go check it out. You....""
Meryl cut him off. ""I'm not about to 
take orders from you. We'll split up and 
go our own separate ways. If you're 
planning on heading for the cargo hold, 
then you'll need me to do something

time -- the coast was clear. He pressed 
forward, past the bodies of the fallen

hold.
The cargo hold was dominated by a 
massive shape covered by a tarp. 
There was no mistaking it -- it was a 
Metal Gear, the ultimate weapon of the 
21st-century.
Sensing the place to be deserted, 
Snake approached the Metal Gear. Its 
immense shadow loomed over him. He 
peeked under the tarp. But what he 
found was nothing more than a decrepit 
shell.
The armor plating was speckled with 
rust. The body was covered with a 
thick layer of dust. The old, badly 
outdated actuator was a crisscross 
road map of tiny cracks. It looked as if 
it hadn't been used in over 10 years.

suddenly sounded behind Snake's

really should treat it with more respect.""
Snake turned around in time to see 
Sergei Gurlukovich emerge from the 
shadow of a pillar.
""Drop your weapon,"" said Gurlukovich.
""Make me,"" Snake retorted.
Gurlukovich dragged another figure out 
from behind the pillar. It was Meryl. He 
drew her closer and jabbed his gun 
against her throat. Snake watched as 
the barrel slowly traced the contours 
of her slender, white neck and brushed 
gently against the corner of her mouth. 
He threw down his gun.
""A wise choice,"" said Gurlukovich.
""All right, Gurlukovich. Let her go!""
Meryl shook off Gurlukovich's grasp. 
Gurlukovich pointed his gun at Snake. 
He regarded Meryl with a leer. 
Suddenly, Snake realized what was

0x4cb53,"Snake closed the watertight door 
behind him and turned the handle to 
lock it. That should buy me some time, 
he thought. In the meantime, there was 
something he had to check on. He 
called Campbell on the Codec and 
described what had happened.
""Meryl and Gurlukovich...."" Campbell's 
voice quivered.
""Meryl said something about her 
'father's dying wish.' What the hell was 
your brother doing in this country, 
anyway?""
Campbell explained.
During the Cold War, while the country 
was under the control of a 
pro-American dictator, the American 
military had been conducting a 
top-secret project in Eldera. Matt 
Campbell had been a member of that 
project. When the Cold War ended, the 
project was terminated as well, and the 
Americans had prepared to withdraw 
from the country. Matt, however, went 
AWOL. Shortly afterward, the 
pro-American regime, having lost its 
backing, was faced with armed 
uprisings among the country's minority 
groups. Eldera was plunged into civil 
war. Matt's corpse was discovered 
later. Spetsnaz had been behind the 
uprising. And the name of their 
commander was Sergei Gurlukovich.
""Some say that Matt was actually 
collaborating with Gurlukovich. But I 
don't believe it for a minute."" 
Campbell's words made it sound as if 
he believed that Gurlukovich himself 
had killed Matt.
""Is that why you've been so obsessed 
with Gurlukovich for all this time?"" 
asked Snake.
""...Yes,"" admitted Campbell. He hated 
Gurlukovich. Hatred spawned hatred in 
kind.
""Were you involved in the project, 
too?""
""No. There's a rule against that. We're 
forbidden to take part in an operation 
involving family members. They say it 
compromises your judgment.""
""Is that all?""
""...I guess Matt wanted to put some 
distance between us at the time."" 
Campbell's voice was tinged with 
regret. But he ventured no explanation 
as to the reason behind his brother's 
actions. ""The antique Metal Gear you 
saw is the end result of that project.... 
That's all I know. The whole thing is 
highly confidential. Even now, the 
records are all sealed.""
I believe it, thought Snake to himself. 
After all, it was only natural for people 
to try and forget horrible things that 
happened in the past. Governments 
were no exception. But some people 
held on to these kinds of memories. 
Some people never forgot their hate. 
Like Gurlukovich and Campbell.
""Snake, we can't let Gurlukovich and

said Campbell. ""It could still be armed 
with live nuclear warheads. They're 
probably planning to test the Metal 
Gear's capabilities somewhere out at 
sea. You've got to change the course 
of the ship. Head for the bridge.""
Snake had no objections.#C0
","Snake closed the watertight door 
behind him and turned the handle to 
lock it. That should buy me some time, 
he thought. In the meantime, there was 
something he had to check on. He 
called Campbell on the Codec and 
described what had happened.
""Meryl and Gurlukovich...."" Campbell's 
voice quivered.
""Meryl said something about her 
'father's dying wish.' What the hell was 
your brother doing in this country, 
anyway?""
Campbell explained.
During the Cold War, while the country 
was under the control of a 
pro-American dictator, the American 
military had been conducting a 
top-secret project in Eldera. Matt 
Campbell had been a member of that 
project. When the Cold War ended, the 
project was terminated as well, and the 
Americans had prepared to withdraw 
from the country. Matt, however, went 
AWOL. Shortly afterward, the 
pro-American regime, having lost its 
backing, was faced with armed 
uprisings among the country's minority 
groups. Eldera was plunged into civil 
war. Matt's corpse was discovered 
later. Spetsnaz had been behind the 
uprising. And the name of their 
commander was Sergei Gurlukovich.
""Some say that Matt was actually 
collaborating with Gurlukovich. But I 
don't believe it for a minute."" 
Campbell's words made it sound as if 
he believed that Gurlukovich himself 
had killed Matt.
""Is that why you've been so obsessed 
with Gurlukovich for all this time?"" 
asked Snake.
""...Yes,"" admitted Campbell. He hated 
Gurlukovich. Hatred spawned hatred in 
kind.
""Were you involved in the project, 
too?""
""No. There's a rule against that. We're 
forbidden to take part in an operation 
involving family members. They say it 
compromises your judgment.""
""Is that all?""
""...I guess Matt wanted to put some 
distance between us at the time."" 
Campbell's voice was tinged with 
regret. But he ventured no explanation 
as to the reason behind his brother's 
actions. ""The antique Metal Gear you 
saw is the end result of that project.... 
That's all I know. The whole thing is 
highly confidential. Even now, the 
records are all sealed.""
I believe it, thought Snake to himself. 
After all, it was only natural for people 
to try and forget horrible things that 
happened in the past. Governments 
were no exception. But some people 
held on to these kinds of memories. 
Some people never forgot their hate. 
Like Gurlukovich and Campbell.
""Snake, we can't let Gurlukovich and 
his men escape with that Metal Gear,"" 
said Campbell. ""It could still be armed 
with live nuclear warheads. They're 
probably planning to test the Metal 
Gear's capabilities somewhere out at 
sea. You've got to change the course 
of the ship. Head for the bridge.""

bridge. Outside the window, beyond the 
storm, he could see the figure of Meryl. 
He opened the watertight door and 
stepped into the navigation room. 
Meryl turned around.
""You're late.""
""Were you waiting for me?""
""There's no one to interrupt us here. I 
need to tell you something.""
""You mean like the reason why you're 
helping the man who killed your 
father?""
""Is that what my uncle told you?""
Snake nodded. Meryl shook her head.
""He was lying.""
Meryl explained.
Matt Campbell's part in the top-secret 
Metal Gear development project in 
Eldera had been to ensure the 
country's stability. Part of his job was 
feeding falsified information to the 
minority separatist guerrillas, and he 
was good at it. First, he'd pick a 
suitable candidate. Next, he'd find his 
target's weak point and use it to 
blackmail him. Then he'd dangle a 
carrot in front of the victim's eyes and 
convince him to cooperate. Matt would 
then send his now-willing accomplice 
into the ranks of the separatists. Once 
there, the spy provided the Americans 
with useful information, selling out his 
comrades in the process.
But in carrying out his mission, Matt 
made one fatal error. In his dealings 
with the separatists, he came to 
sympathize with their cause. He 
became enchanted with the idea of 
independence. He grew to resent the 
U.S. for the way it exploited smaller, 
weaker nations for its own gain. In the 
end, Matt decided to help the guerrillas 
create their own nation. He wanted to 
give them the trump card they needed 
to secure their independence. And 
what better gift than a bipedal, 
nuclear-capable walking tank that was 
conveniently being developed in Eldera 
(albeit secretly and quite illegally) by 
the American military? Sergei 
Gurlukovich, who was also supporting 
the guerrillas, agreed to cooperate.
Matt's plan was executed. The guerrillas 
succeeded in stealing the Metal Gear 
from the American base. But then their 
plan was discovered. Matt was 
executed by the Americans. Meryl's 
father had been punished for the crime 
of believing in his own ideals. The price 
of having a conscience was high in 
those troubled times. In the tumult of 
the civil war that followed, the Metal 
Gear disappeared without a trace. 
However, six months ago, its existence 
was reconfirmed, and the Marines had 
been sent to recover their long-lost 
dirty secret.
After hearing the true story from 
Gurlukovich, Meryl agreed to follow his 
instructions and infiltrate the Marines. 
Her intent was to transfer the Metal 
Gear over to the guerrillas through 
Gurlukovich, who was still providing 
support to the rebels. In this way, she 
could carry on her father's memory and 
the ideals for which he died.
""Is that what Gurlukovich told you?"" 
asked Snake.
Meryl nodded. Snake shook his head.
""Didn't it ever occur to you that he 
might be lying?""
Meryl looked at Snake with sorrow in 
her eyes. ""...You're not going to let me 
get away, are you?""
""So what are you going to do?""
Meryl drew her gun and pointed it at 
Snake.
""You're not going to shoot me,"" said 
Snake.

Eldera était un petit pays d'Amérique latine
en pleine guerre civile. Depuis les années
1980, le pays était sous le contrôle d'un
régime dictatorial pro-américain. Mais, alors
que la Guerre froide se terminait et que
l'influence américaine dans la région
s'estompait, la minorité ethnique du pays
s'était insurgée contre le gouvernement et
demandait la création d'un Etat séparé.
Depuis, le pays était déchiré par la guerre
civile.
Les mercenaires et les marchands d'armes
ne cessaient d'entrer et de sortir d'Eldera.
Dans ces circonstances, estimait Campbell,
il ne serait pas étonnant qu'un côté ou
l'autre ait réussi à mettre la main sur un
nouveau type de Metal Gear. Visiblement, il
y avait encore des gens qui croyaient que la
menace du nucléaire pourrait amener la
stabilité dans la région.
""Et les marines étaient là pour tenter de le
détruire ?"" demanda Snake.
""Non. Il semblerait qu'ils étaient là pour s'en
emparer. Nous ignorons encore beaucoup
de choses sur la véritable nature du
nouveau Metal Gear. C'était l'occasion
idéale d'obtenir des informations
précieuses.""
En d'autres termes, Eldera avait réussi à se
procurer un nouveau type de Metal Gear,
les marines voulaient s'en emparer et
Gurlukovich voulait le voler aux marines. Et
maintenant Campbell proposait à Snake de
courir après Gurlukovich.
Snake secoua la tête. ""Désolé, mais il
faudra trouver quelqu'un d'autre cette fois.
Je ne suis plus un héros.""
""Snake...""
""Les temps changent, Colonel. Il est temps
de passer à autre chose.""
""Tu veux dire se retirer du militaire ?""
""Non, je veux dire cesser cette sale
vendetta contre Gurlukovich.""
La fureur qui assombrit le visage de
Campbell confirma les doutes de Snake.
Campbell vouait toujours une haine sans
borne à Gurlukovich. Elle remontait à la
Guerre froide. Le temps ne l'avait pas
estompée. Au contraire, il l'avait renforcée.
""Et c'est pour ça que tu as rejoint la DIA ?""
""... Oui, tu as raison. Mais je n'ai pas fait
tout ce chemin pour te demander de m'aider

des poings.

Eldera était un petit pays d'Amérique latine
en pleine guerre civile. Depuis les années
1980, le pays était sous le contrôle d'un
régime dictatorial pro-américain. Mais, alors
que la Guerre froide se terminait et que
l'influence américaine dans la région
s'estompait, la minorité ethnique du pays
s'était insurgée contre le gouvernement et
demandait la création d'un Etat séparé.
Depuis, le pays était déchiré par la guerre
civile.
Les mercenaires et les marchands d'armes
ne cessaient d'entrer et de sortir d'Eldera.
Dans ces circonstances, estimait Campbell,
il ne serait pas étonnant qu'un côté ou
l'autre ait réussi à mettre la main sur un
nouveau type de Metal Gear. Visiblement, il
y avait encore des gens qui croyaient que la
menace du nucléaire pourrait amener la
stabilité dans la région.
""Et les marines étaient là pour tenter de le
détruire ?"" demanda Snake.
""Non. Il semblerait qu'ils étaient là pour s'en
emparer. Nous ignorons encore beaucoup
de choses sur la véritable nature du
nouveau Metal Gear. C'était l'occasion
idéale d'obtenir des informations
précieuses.""
En d'autres termes, Eldera avait réussi à se
procurer un nouveau type de Metal Gear,
les marines voulaient s'en emparer et
Gurlukovich voulait le voler aux marines. Et
maintenant Campbell proposait à Snake de
courir après Gurlukovich.
Snake secoua la tête. ""Désolé, mais il
faudra trouver quelqu'un d'autre cette fois.
Je ne suis plus un héros.""
""Snake...""
""Les temps changent, Colonel. Il est temps
de passer à autre chose.""
""Tu veux dire se retirer du militaire ?""
""Non, je veux dire cesser cette sale
vendetta contre Gurlukovich.""
La fureur qui assombrit le visage de
Campbell confirma les doutes de Snake.
Campbell vouait toujours une haine sans
borne à Gurlukovich. Elle remontait à la
Guerre froide. Le temps ne l'avait pas
estompée. Au contraire, il l'avait renforcée.
""Et c'est pour ça que tu as rejoint la DIA ?""
""... Oui, tu as raison. Mais je n'ai pas fait
tout ce chemin pour te demander de m'aider
à laver mon linge sale."" Campbell serrait
des poings.
""... La vérité est que... Meryl était de la
mission.""

Le bateau pneumatique se rapprocha du
pétrolier. Snake s'agrippa à la corde.
Meryl Silverburg. La nièce de Campbell. La
femme qui avait risqué sa vie avec Snake à
Shadow Moses. Ils avaient même vécu
ensemble. Puis, six mois plus tôt, Meryl
l'avait quitté. Elle avait dit qu'elle avait
quelque chose d'important à régler. Sa voix
était décidée. Ses yeux étaient clairs et
froids comme l'acier. Snake ne pouvait pas
l'arrêter.

Snake grimpa à la corde sur la Shell du
pétrolier et se retrouva sur le pont arrière.
Des soldats étaient postés tout près. C'était
des mercenaires russes. Il appela Campbell
sur le Codec.
""C'est Snake. J'ai réussi à m'infiltrer sur le
pétrolier. On dirait que nos amis russes sont
déjà maîtres à bord. Je vais essayer
d'entrer en contact avec Meryl.""#C0

""Je voulais seulement te voir,"" répondit
Snake.

""En fait, je ne plaisantais qu'à moitié.""
""... C'est mon oncle qui t'a envoyé ?""
Snake hocha la tête et expliqua que
Campbell avait appris l'attaque de
Gurlukovich.
""Tu en as du culot de venir ici !"" répliqua
Meryl.
""Tu peux parler,"" rétorqua Snake.
""Comment !?""
""T'infiltrer dans un autre pays sous le
couvert d'une opération militaire alors que
tout ce que tu veux c'est le Metal Gear. Qui
a le culot de venir ici ?"" Sa voix prit un ton
condamnatoire. ""C'est ça la « chose
importante » que tu avais à régler ?""
""... Tu ne comprendrais pas."" Meryl se
détourna. ""Quelqu'un comme toi qui
passerait volontiers le reste de sa vie à
s'occuper de chiens de traîneau ne peut pas
comprendre.""
""J'essaie seulement de ne plus vivre dans la
haine.""
""Non. Tu refuses de voir la réalité en face,
c'est tout. La société, ton passé... même
moi.""
""... C'est pour ça que tu es partie ?""
""Non, ce n'est pas pour ça..."" Mais le regard
de Meryl disait à Snake que ce pourrait être
pour ça. Un silence profond s'installa. Six
mois de séparation avaient créé un vide
froid difficile à combler. Enfin, Meryl rompit
le silence.
""... Mon père... il est mort ici, dans ce
pays,"" murmura-t-elle.
Matt Campbell, le père de Meryl et le frère
cadet de Campbell, était un agent de la DIA.
Snake savait qu'il était mort en mission
quand Meryl était très jeune.
""Je voulais voir ce que mon père a vu...""
Les yeux de Meryl errèrent par la fenêtre,
mais il n'y avait rien à voir, que la tempête
qui faisait rage dehors. Elle se retourna
soudain vers Snake et soutint son regard.
 “Snake, pars d'ici. C'est mon champ de
bataille. Je ne veux pas qu'une personne
extérieure s'en mêle.""
""Il est trop tard. J'y suis déjà mêlé.""
""Rien ne te fera changer d'avis ?""
""Rien,"" répondit Snake fermement.
Meryl soupira d'exaspération. Snake fit
semblant de ne pas remarquer.
""Bien, explique-moi. Cette mission était
censée être top secret, non ? Alors,
comment Gurlukovich en a-t-il entendu
parler ?""
""C'est aussi ce que je voudrais savoir.""
""Tu crois qu'il y a eu une fuite ?""
""J'en doute. Mais comme tu es déjà au
courant, je suppose que n'importe qui
pourrait l'être.""
Snake réfléchit un moment. Meryl avait
raison. N'importe qui pouvait savoir. Mais
qu'importe. Ils devaient empêcher
Gurlukovich de mettre la main sur le Metal
Gear.
""Où est le Metal Gear ?""
""Dans la soute.""
""Bien. Je vais voir. Tu...""
Meryl le coupa. ""Je ne suis pas sous tes
ordres. Chacun de son côté. Mais si tu veux
aller dans la soute, il va falloir que je fasse
quelque chose à propos des cartons qui
bloquent les escaliers du premier pont.""

Vor drei Tagen hatte Campbell Snake zu
Hause in Alaska besucht. Im Gegensatz zu
Snake, der nach dem Zwischenfall auf
Shadow Moses wieder in Pension gegangen
war, hatte sich Campbell einen Posten bei
der Defense Intelligence Agency besorgt.
Snake war sofort klar, dass Campbell nicht
gekommen war, um alte Verbindungen mit
einem früheren Kameraden wieder aufleben
zu lassen.
Nach kurzem Smalltalk kam Campbell direkt
auf den Punkt.
""Erinnern Sie sich an einen gewissen
Sergei Gurlukovich?""
Snake nickte. Gurlukovich, ein ehemaliger
GRU-Oberst, war als unbarmherziger,
kaltblütiger Stratege bekannt. Als Campbell
während des Kalten Krieges Kommandeur
von FOXHOUND war, hatte ihn Gurlukovich
bei zahlreichen Gelegenheiten gedemütigt.
Nach dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion
hatte er aus einer Gruppe ehemaliger
Soldaten der Roten Armee seine eigene
persönliche Söldnerarmee aufgebaut.
Seidem waren Gurlukovich und seine
Truppen von einer Kriegszone zur nächsten
gegangen und hatten ihre Dienste dem
jeweils höchsten Anbieter verkauft.
""Wir erhielten einen Bericht darüber, dass
Gurlukovich und seine Männer eine Gruppe
von Marines angriffen, die sich in geheimer
Mission in der südamerikanischen Republik
Eldera befanden. Die Marines schweigen
sich darüber aus ? wie gewöhnlich wollen
sie die ganze Angelegenheit lieber in
Vergessenheit geraten lassen.
Aber soweit wir sagen können, scheint Metal
Gear einbezogen zu sein.""
""Metal Gear?"" knurrte Snake. Er hatte die
Gerüchte auch gehört. Nach dem
Zwischenfall auf Shadow Moses waren die
technischen Spezifikationen für Metal Gear
auf den schwarzen Markt durchgesickert.
Als ein Ergebnis tauchten überall in der Welt
Nachahmungen von Metal Gear auf. Eldera
war ein kleines Land in Süamerika, in dem
ein Bürgerkrieg tobte. Seit den 1980er
Jahren wurde es von einer
proamerikanischen Diktatur regiert. Aber als
der Kalte Krieg seinem Ende entgegenging,
verringerte sich der amerikanische Einfluss
in der Region, die ethnische Minderheit des
Lands ergriff die Waffen gegen die
Regierung und wollte einen eigenen Staat
gründen. Seitdem ist das Land durch den
Bürgerkrieg in sich zerissen.
In Eldera herrschte ein reges Kommen und
Gehen von Söldner und Waffenhändlern.
Unter diesen Umständen hielt es Campbell
für keine allzu große Überraschung, wenn
die eine oder die andere Seite in den Besitz
eines neuen Typs von Metal Gear gelangt
wäre. Manche Leute schienen noch dem
Glauben anzuhängen, dass die Drohung mit
einem nuklearen Krieg der Region Stabilität
bringen könnte.
""Und die Marines waren da, um die Waffe
möglichst zu zerstören?"" fragte Snake.
""Nein. Anscheinend wollten sie sie in ihre
Gewalt bringen. Über die wahre Natur des
neuen Metal Gear ist uns noch nicht sehr
viel bekannt. Dies wäre eine gute Chance
gewesen, viele wertvolle Informationen zu
bekommen.""
Mit anderen Worten konnte sich Eldera
einen neuen Typ von Metal Gear
verschaffen, die Marines planten, die Waffe
in ihre Gewalt zu bekommen und
Gurlukovich wollte sie den Marines stehlen.
Und jetzt schlug Campbell vor, Gurlukovich
zu jagen.
Snake schüttelte den Kopf. ""Tut mir leid,
aber diesmal werden Sie für Ihre schmutzige
Arbeit einen anderen finden müssen. Ich bin
aus dem Heldengeschäft raus.""
""Snake...""
""Die Zeiten ändern sich, Oberst. Ich
glaube, es ist an der Zeit, die ganze Sache
ruhen zu lassen.""
""Sie meinen, ich sollte mich vom Militär
zurückziehen?""
""Nein, ich meine, Sie sollten diesen
Rachefeldzug gegen Gurlukovich sein
lassen.""
Campbells wütender Gesichtsausdruck
bestätigte Snakes Verdacht. Campbell
hasste Gurlukovich immer noch wie die
Pest. Es war ein alter Groll, der vom Kalten
Krieg übrig geblieben war. Er war mit der
Zeit nicht schwächer, sondern eher noch
stärker geworden.
""Sind Sie deshalb zur DIA gegangen? Um
alte Rechnungen zu begleichen?""
""... Ja, Sie haben Recht. Aber ich bin nicht
den weiten Weg hierher gekommen, um Sie
wegen eines alten Grolls um Hilfe zu bitten.""
Campbell ballte die Hände zur Faust.
""... Die Wahrheit ist... Meryl war an jener
Mission beteiligt.""

Er reagierte blitzschnell und sprang hinter

begrüßte ihn kein Kugelhagel - die Bahn
war frei. Er drängte vorwärts an den
gefallenen feindlichen Soldaten vorbei und
betrat den Frachtraum.
Den Frachtraum beherrschte ein massives
Objekt, das mit einer Plane abgedeckt war.
Da konnte es keinen Irrtum geben - das
war ein Metal Gear, die allerneueste Waffe
des 21. Jahrhunderts.
Snake spürte, dass niemand im Frachtraum
war und näherte sich dem Metal Gear. Sein
gewaltiger Schatten tauchte über ihm auf. Er
spähte unter die Plane. Aber da sah er
nichts weiter als ein altersschwaches Wrack.
Die Panzerung war voller Rostflecken. Eine
dicke Staubschicht bedeckte den Körper.
Das völlig veraltete Bedienteil war mit feinen
Rissen übersät. Es schien seit mehr als 10
Jahren nicht mehr benutzt worden zu sein.

plötzlich jemand hinter Snakes
Rücken. ""Was Sie da sehen, ist eine
großartige Hinterlassenschaft des
Hasses, die mein berühmter Vorgänger
mir vererbt hat. Sie sollten sie wirklich mit
mehr Respekt behandeln.""
Snake drehte sich schnell um und sah, wie
Sergei Gurlukovich aus dem Schatten eines
Pfeilers auftauchte.
""Waffe weg!"" rief Gurlukovich.
""Holen Sie sie sich doch!"" erwiderte Snake.
Gurlukovich zerrte jemanden hinter dem
Pfeiler hervor. Es war Meryl. Er zog sie
näher zu sich und hielt ihr die Waffe an die
Kehle. Dann bewegte er den Lauf entlang
der Konturen ihres schlanken weißen Halses
und strich ihr schließlich sanft damit am
Mundwinkel entlang. Snake warf die Waffe
weg.
""Ein weiser Entschluss"", sagte Gurlukovich.
""In Ordnung, Gurlukovich. Lassen Sie sie
gehen!""
Meryl schüttelte Gurlukovichs Griff ab.
Gurlukovich zielte auf Snake. Er warf einen
Seitenblick auf Meryl. Plötzlich wurde Snake
klar, was da vor sich ging. Meryl arbeitete
mit Gurlukovich zusammen. Und das
bedeutete...
""... Du warst also die undichte Stelle?""
Meryl schwieg und bestätigte damit Snakes
Befürchtungen.
""Aber warum?""
""... Und wenn ich dir sagte, es wäre der
letzte Wille meines Vaters gewesen?"" Meryl
sah Snake flehend an. ""... Ich bitte dich
noch einmal. Verlasse den Tanker.""
""Das kann ich nicht.""
Gurlukovich spannte die Waffe. ""Dann muss
ich Sie einfach loswerden!""
Er zog ab ...
""Nein!"" Meryl packte von der Seite
Gurlukovichs Hand. Die Kugel verfehlte ihr
Ziel und traf den Boden zwischen Snakes
Füßen. ""Wir hatten eine Vereinbarung! Sie
hatten versprochen, ihn nicht zu töten!""
Die beiden stritten sich weiter, so dass
Snake seine USP aufheben und flüchten
konnte. Im Fliehen hörte er, wie
Gurlukovich seine Leute verärgert
anschrie.
""Tötet ihn!""
Snake hörte auch, wie Meryl Gurlukovich
aufhalten wollte. Aber Snake drehte sich

sich und drehte den Griff, um sie zu
verschließen. Damit gewinne ich Zeit,
dachte er. In der Zwischenzeit musste er
etwas nachprüfen. Er rief Campbell über den
Codec und erzählte, was geschehen war.
""Meryl und Gurlukovich..."" Campbells
Stimme bebte.
""Meryl hat etwas vom 'letzten Willen ihres
Vaters' erwähnt. Was zum Kuckuck hatte
denn Ihr Bruder in diesem Land zu tun?""
Campbell erzählte.
Während des Kalten Kriegs, als das Land
von einem proamerikanischen Diktator
regiert wurde, hatte das amerikanische
Militär in Eldera an einem streng
geheimen Projekt gearbeitet. Matt Campbell
gehörte zum Projektteam. Als der Kalte
Krieg zu Ende ging, wurde auch das Projekt
abgebrochen und die Amerikaner bereiteten
den Rückzug aus dem Land vor. Matt
entfernte sich aber unerlaubt von der
Truppe. Kurze Zeit später gab es einen
bewaffneten Aufstand der
Minderheitsgruppen des Landes gegen das
proamerikanische Regime, das seinen
Rückhalt verloren hatte. Eldera wurde von
einem Bürgerkrieg heimgesucht. Matts
Leiche wurde später gefunden. Hinter
dem Aufstand standen die Spetznaz und ihr
Kommandeur hieß Sergei Gurlukovich.
""Gerüchten zufolge soll Matt mit
Gurlukovich zusammengearbeitet haben.
Aber das glaube ich nicht eine Minute.""
Campbells Worte ließen seine Annahme
durchblicken, dass Gurlukovich Matt getötet
hätte.
""Sind Sie deshalb die ganze Zeit so von
Gurlukovich besessen gewesen?"" fragte
Snake.
""Ja"", gab Campbell zu. Er hasste
Gurlukovich. Hass erzeugte Gegenhass.
""Waren Sie auch in das Projekt
einbezogen?""
""Nein. Es gibt eine Regel, die das nicht
zulässt. Wir dürfen an keiner Operation
teilnehmen, die mit Familienangehörigen zu
tun hat, weil das Urteilsvermögen dabei
eingeschränkt wäre.""
""Ist das alles?""
""Ich glaube, Matt wollte damals etwas
Abstand gewinnen"", sagte Campbell mit
einem bedauernden Ton. Aber er gab keine
Erklärung für die Gründe der
Aktionen seines Bruders. ""Der alte Metal
Gear, den Sie gesehen haben, ist das
Endergebnis des Projekts... Mehr weiß
ich auch nicht. Die ganze Angelegenheit ist
streng vertraulich. Selbst heute sind noch

Ich glaube ihm, dachte Snake. Schließlich
war es ganz natürlich, dass Menschen
schreckliche Dinge vergessen wollten, die in
der Vergangenheit geschehen waren. Und
Regierungen bildeten da keine Ausnahme.
Aber manche hielten an solchen
Erinnerungen fest. Manche können ihren
Hass nie vergessen. Gurlukovich und
Campbell gehörten dazu.
""Snake, wir dürfen Gurlukovich und
seine Leute nicht mit diesem Metal Gear
entkommen lassen"", sagte Campbell. ""Er

Matt Campbells Aufgabe bei dem streng
geheimen Entwicklungsprojekt Metal Gear in
Eldera bestand darin, die Stabilität des
Lands sicherzustellen. Dazu gehörte, die
separatistischen Minderheitenguerillas mit
gezinkten Informationen zu versorgen, und
das brachte er gut. Zunächst wählte er
einen geeigneten Kandidaten aus. Dann
fand er den schwachen Punkt dieser
Zielperson und erpresste sie. Danach hielt
er dem Opfer einen Köder hin und
überzeugte es zur Zusammenarbeit.
Schließlich schickte Matt den nunmehr
bereitwilligen Komplizen in die Reihen der
Separatisten. Von da aus lieferte der Spion
nützliche Informationen an die Amerikaner
und verkaufte dabei seine eigenen
Kameraden.
Bei dieser Mission machte Matt allerdings
einen fatalen Fehler. Bei den Geschäften
mit den Separatisten wurde er zum
Sympathisanten. Er begeisterte sich für
die Unabhängigkeitsidee. Ihm bereitete es
zunehmend Verdruss, wie die USA kleinere,
schwächere Nationen für ihre eigenen
Zwecke ausnutzten. Schließlich beschloss
Matt, den Guerillas bei der Schaffung einer
eigenen Nation zu helfen. Er wollte ihnen
den Trumpf geben, den sie dafür
brauchten. War da nicht ein zweibeiniger
Panzer mit nuklearer Fähigkeit das beste
Geschenk, das zudem in Eldera (geheim
und illegal) vom USA-Militär entwickelt
wurde? Gurlukovich, der die Guerillas
ebenfalls unterstützte, erklärte sich zur
Zusammenarbeit bereit.
Matts Plan wurde ausgeführt. Die
Guerillas konnten den Metal Gear vom
amerikanischen Stützpunkt stehlen. Aber
dann wurde ihr Plan entdeckt. Matt wurde
von den Amerikanern exekutiert. Meryls
Vater war für das Verbrechen bestraft
worden, an seine eigenen Ideen zu glauben.
Der Preis für ein Gewissen war hoch in
jenen schwierigen Zeiten. Im Tumult des
sich anschließenden Bürgerkriegs
verschwand der Metal Gear spurlos. Vor
sechs Monaten wurde er aber wieder
entdeckt und die Marines wurden geschickt,
um ihr lange verlorenes, schmutziges
Geheimnis zu bergen.
Nachdem Meryl die wahre Geschichte von
Gurlukovich gehört hatte, erklärte sie sich
bereit, seinen Anweisungen zu folgen und
die Marines zu infiltrieren. Sie beabsichtigte,
den Guerillas über Gurlukovich, der die
Rebellen immer noch unterstützte, den
Metal Gear zu übergeben. Auf diese Weise
konnte sie das Gedächtnis an Ihren Vater
ehren und die Ideale, für die er gestorben
war, weiterführen.

""Was wollen Sie damit sagen?""
""Meryl ist meine Tochter.""
Snake war wie vom Donner gerührt. Völlig
ungläubig starrte er Campbell an. ""Also...
Sie und die Frau Ihres Bruders...?""
Campbell nickte. ""... Ich wusste, dass ich
etwas Unverzeihliches getan hatte. Aber ich
dachte, sie..."" Er senkte den Kopf.
""Wusste Matt davon?""
""Er spürte, dass etwas nicht stimmte.
Deshalb ging er allein nach Eldera ? er
wollte von uns weg. Und da fand ihn
Gurlukovich...""
Die erste nachrichtendienstliche Regel
lautet: Suche den Schwachpunkt des
Gegners. Grabe die Geister seiner
Vergangenheit aus. Reibe Salz in seine
alten Wunden. Täusche dann Mitgefühl vor.
Gewinne sein Vertrauen. Stiehl sein Herz.
Und dann hast du ihn unter Kontrolle. Mit
Matt hatte Gurlukovich die perfekte
Zielperson gefunden.
""... Weiss Meryl davon?""
""Nein. Aber... Ich wollte es ihr schon
sagen.""
Damit drehte sich Campbell um und ging
zum Besucherraum. Snake sah, wie er in
der Ferne verschwand und dachte nach. Es
würde einige Zeit dauern, bis Meryl die
Wahrheit über das Geschehene
akzeptieren würde. Er war sich nicht
einmal sicher, ob sie Campbell je als Vater
anerkennen würde. Aber Snake würde
es genügen, wenn sie sich eines Tages
wieder zulächeln könnten. In der Welt
war kein Platz für noch mehr Hass.#C0

sbatacchiato avanti e indietro sulle onde

Tre giorni prima, Campbell era andato a
trovare Snake nella sua casa in Alaska.
Snake si era ritirato dal lavoro dopo
l'incidente di Shadow Moses, mentre
Campbell si era fatto una posizione nei
Servizi Segreti della Difesa (la DIA). Snake
aveva capito subito che Campbell non si
trovava lì per riallacciare vecchi rapporti con
il suo ex commilitone.
Dopo avere fatto quattro chiacchiere,
Campbell andò subito al sodo.
""Ti ricordi di un uomo che si chiamava
Sergei Gurlukovich?""
Snake annuì. Ex colonnello dei GRU,
Gurlukovich era rinomato come stratega
crudele e spietato. Durante la Guerra
Fredda, quando Campbell era al comando di
FOXHOUND, Gurlukovich lo aveva umiliato
in diverse occasioni. Dopo il crollo
dell'Unione Sovietica, aveva reclutato un
gruppo di ex soldati dell'Armata Rossa per
formare un esercito personale di mercenari.
Da allora, Gurlukovich e le sue truppe si
spostavano da un'area di guerra all'altra,
vendendo i servizi al migliore offerente.
""Siamo stati informati che Gurlukovich e i
suoi uomini hanno attaccato un gruppo di
Marines in missione segreta nella repubblica
sudamericana di Eldera. Come al solito, i
Marines hanno le bocche cucite sulla
faccenda: preferirebbero metterci una pietra
sopra.
Ma da quel che ne sappiamo, sembra che
sia coinvolto il Metal Gear.""
""Metal Gear?"" ringhiò Snake. Anche lui
aveva sentito questa voce. In seguito
all'incidente di Shadow Moses, le specifiche
tecniche del Metal Gear erano state vendute
al mercato nero. Di conseguenza, in tutto il
mondo iniziarono a spuntare copie di Metal
Gear. Eldera era un piccolo Paese del Sud
America coinvolto in una guerra civile. Dagli
anni '80 il Paese era stato sotto il controllo
di un regime dittatoriale filoamericano, ma
quando la Guerra Fredda ebbe fine e
l'America cessò di estendere la sua
influenza in quella regione, la minoranza
etnica del Paese imbracciò le armi contro il
Governo, reclamando la costituzione di una
nazione separata. Da allora, il Paese era
stato dilaniato dalla guerra civile.
Mercenari e mercanti di armi facevano la
spola a Eldera. Date le circostanze, aveva
immaginato Campbell, non ci sarebbe stato
da stupirsi se l'uno o l'altro schieramento
fosse riuscito a impossessarsi di un nuovo
tipo di Metal Gear. A quanto pareva, alcuni
erano ancora convinti che la minaccia della
guerra nucleare potesse riportare la stabilità
nella regione.
""E i Marines erano lì per tentare di
distruggerlo?"" chiese Snake.
""No. Sembra che stessero tentando di
impossessarsene. Sappiamo ancora ben
poco sulle potenzialità del nuovo Metal
Gear. Questa sarebbe stata un'ottima
occasione per recuperare tante informazioni
preziose.""
In altre parole, Eldera era riuscita a
procurarsi un nuovo tipo di Metal Gear, i
Marines avevano un piano per
impossessarsene, Gurlukovich aveva
intenzione di sottrarlo ai Marines e ora
Campbell intendeva rintracciare Gurlukovich.
Snake scosse la testa. ""Scusi, ma questa
volta dovrà trovare qualcun altro che faccia
il lavoro sporco. Ormai sono fuori dal giro
degli eroi.""
""Snake...""
""I tempi cambiano, Colonnello. Credo sia
ora che pensiate a riposarvi.""
""Dovrei ritirarmi dall'esercito?""
""No. Voglio dire che dovreste smetterla con
questa dannata faida contro Gurlukovich.""
Lo sguardo infuriato di Campbell confermò i
sospetti di Snake: Campbell nutriva ancora
un odio implacabile per Gurlukovich. Era un
vecchio rancore che si trascinava dalla
Guerra Fredda. Il tempo non lo aveva
scalfito affatto, anzi, lo aveva intensificato.
""È per questo che siete entrato nella DIA?
Per saldare i conti in sospeso?""
""... Già, hai ragione. Ma non ho fatto tutta
questa strada per chiedere il tuo aiuto solo
per un rancore personale."" Campbell serrò i
pugni.
""... Il fatto è che... Meryl faceva parte di
quella missione.""

Il gommone si accostò al tanker e Snake
afferrò saldamente la fune.
Meryl Silverburg era la nipote di Campbell,
la donna che a Shadow Moses aveva
rischiato la vita a fianco di Snake. Per un
periodo avevano convissuto. Poi, sei mesi
prima, Meryl lo aveva lasciato, dicendo che
doveva occuparsi di qualcosa di importante.
La sua voce era risoluta, i suoi occhi chiari
e freddi come l'acciaio. Snake non poté fare
niente per fermarla.

Snake si arrampicò sulla fune lungo lo scafo
esterno del tanker e sbucò sul ponte di
poppa. Riuscì a vedere che lì vicino c'erano
dei soldati di guardia. Sembravano dei
mercenari russi. Chiamò Campbell sul
Codec.

abbiano già preso il controllo della nave.

0x5d1db,"Snake si chiuse alle spalle il portello a
tenuta stagna e girò la maniglia di blocco.
Così avrebbe guadagnato tempo, pensò. Nel
frattempo, aveva qualcosa da controllare.
Chiamò Campbell sul Codec e gli descrisse
l'accaduto.
""Meryl e Gurlukovich..."" disse Campbell con
voce tremante.
""Meryl ha detto qualcosa del 'desiderio del
padre in punto di morte'. A proposito, cosa
ci faceva suo fratello in questo Paese?""
Campbell gli diede la spiegazione.
Durante la Guerra Fredda, mentre il Paese
era sotto il controllo di un dittatore
filoamericano, le forze militari americane
avevano eseguito un progetto top-secret a
Eldera. Matt Campbell aveva partecipato a
quel progetto. Finita la Guerra Fredda,
anche il progetto fu terminato e gli americani
si erano preparati a lasciare il Paese, ma
Matt si rese irreperibile. Di lì a poco, il
regime filoamericano, avendo perso il
sostegno, dovette affrontare insurrezioni
armate tra le minoranze del Paese. Eldera
piombò così nella guerra civile. Più tardi
trovarono il cadavere di Matt. L'insurrezione
era stata fomentata da Spetznaz, al cui
comando era Sergei Gurlukovich.
""Alcuni dicono che Matt stesse
collaborando con Gurlukovich. Ma non ci ho
creduto neanche per un istante."" Dal modo
in cui l'aveva detto, Campbell riteneva che
fu proprio Gurlukovich a uccidere Matt.
""È per questo che è stato ossessionato da
Gurlukovich per tutto questo tempo?""
chiese Snake.
""...Già,"" ammise Campbell. Odiava
Gurlukovich. L'odio generava altro odio.
""Anche lei era coinvolto nel progetto?""
""No. Il regolamento lo vieta. Abbiamo il
divieto di prendere parte a operazioni in cui
siano coinvolti membri della famiglia. Dicono
che comprometterebbe il giudizio.""
""Non c'è altro?""
""Credo che Matt volesse mantenere le
distanze da me, in quel periodo."" La voce di
Campbell tradì del rimorso. Ma non provò a
spiegare per quale motivo il fratello avesse
agito in quel modo. ""Il vecchio Metal Gear
che hai visto è il risultato finale di quel
progetto... È tutto ciò che so. La faccenda è
molto confidenziale. Le notizie sono tuttora
tenute segrete.""
E ci credo, pensò Snake tra sé e sé. Dopo
tutto, era normale che la gente tentasse di
dimenticare le cose terribili del passato, e i
Governi non facevano eccezione. Ma c'era
chi rimaneva aggrappato a queste memorie:
alcuni non dimenticarono mai l'odio, e tra
questi vi erano Gurlukovich e Campbell.
""Snake, dobbiamo impedire a Gurlukovich e
ai suoi uomini di fuggire con quel Metal
Gear,"" disse Campbell. ""Potrebbe essere
ancora armato con testate nucleari attive.
Avranno intenzione di testare le capacità del
Metal Gear in alto mare. Devi cambiare la
rotta della nave. Dirigiti verso il ponte.""
Snake non aveva obiezioni.#C0
","Snake si chiuse alle spalle il portello a
tenuta stagna e girò la maniglia di blocco.
Così avrebbe guadagnato tempo, pensò. Nel
frattempo, aveva qualcosa da controllare.
Chiamò Campbell sul Codec e gli descrisse
l'accaduto.
""Meryl e Gurlukovich..."" disse Campbell con
voce tremante.
""Meryl ha detto qualcosa del 'desiderio del
padre in punto di morte'. A proposito, cosa
ci faceva suo fratello in questo Paese?""
Campbell gli diede la spiegazione.
Durante la Guerra Fredda, mentre il Paese
era sotto il controllo di un dittatore
filoamericano, le forze militari americane
avevano eseguito un progetto top-secret a
Eldera. Matt Campbell aveva partecipato a
quel progetto. Finita la Guerra Fredda,
anche il progetto fu terminato e gli americani
si erano preparati a lasciare il Paese, ma
Matt si rese irreperibile. Di lì a poco, il
regime filoamericano, avendo perso il
sostegno, dovette affrontare insurrezioni
armate tra le minoranze del Paese. Eldera
piombò così nella guerra civile. Più tardi
trovarono il cadavere di Matt. L'insurrezione
era stata fomentata da Spetznaz, al cui
comando era Sergei Gurlukovich.
""Alcuni dicono che Matt stesse
collaborando con Gurlukovich. Ma non ci ho
creduto neanche per un istante."" Dal modo
in cui l'aveva detto, Campbell riteneva che
fu proprio Gurlukovich a uccidere Matt.
""È per questo che è stato ossessionato da
Gurlukovich per tutto questo tempo?""
chiese Snake.
""...Già,"" ammise Campbell. Odiava
Gurlukovich. L'odio generava altro odio.
""Anche lei era coinvolto nel progetto?""
""No. Il regolamento lo vieta. Abbiamo il
divieto di prendere parte a operazioni in cui
siano coinvolti membri della famiglia. Dicono
che comprometterebbe il giudizio.""
""Non c'è altro?""
""Credo che Matt volesse mantenere le
distanze da me, in quel periodo."" La voce di
Campbell tradì del rimorso. Ma non provò a
spiegare per quale motivo il fratello avesse
agito in quel modo. ""Il vecchio Metal Gear
che hai visto è il risultato finale di quel
progetto... È tutto ciò che so. La faccenda è
molto confidenziale. Le notizie sono tuttora
tenute segrete.""

boccaporto a tenuta stagna ed entrò nella
sala di navigazione. Meryl si voltò.

""Qui non ci sentirà nessuno. Ho qualcosa

""Si tratta del motivo per cui stai aiutando

Snake annuì. Meryl scosse la testa.
""Ha mentito.""
Meryl spiegò tutto.
Il ruolo di Matt Campbell nel progetto
top-secret di sviluppo del Metal Gear a
Eldera consisteva nell'assicurare la stabilità
del Paese. Parte del suo compito era fornire
informazioni false ai gruppi di minoranze
separatiste, e ci riuscì. Doveva prima
scegliere un candidato adatto, poi
individuare il punto debole del suo bersaglio
e usarlo per ricattarlo, quindi doveva agitare
l'esca davanti agli occhi della vittima per
convincerla a collaborare. A quel punto,
Matt avrebbe inviato il suo complice
volontario tra i ranghi dei separatisti. Da lì,
la spia doveva fornire agli americani
informazioni utili, vendendo così i compagni
al nemico.
Ma nel corso della missione, Matt commise
un errore fatale: nelle trattative con i
separatisti, finì per simpatizzare con la loro
causa e si lasciò sedurre dall'ideale
dell'indipendenza. Iniziò a prendersela con
gli Stati Uniti per come sfruttavano le
nazioni più piccole e deboli a loro vantaggio.
Alla fine, Matt decise di aiutare i guerriglieri
a fondare una propria nazione. Voleva dare
loro l'asso nella manica che gli avrebbe
assicurato l'indipendenza. E cosa c'era di
meglio di un carro armato bipede con
capacità nucleare che, guarda caso, veniva
sviluppato a Eldera (anche se nel segreto e
illegalmente) dai militari americani? Anche
Sergei Gurlukovich sosteneva i guerriglieri e
accettò di collaborare.
Il piano di Matt venne eseguito: i guerriglieri
riuscirono a sottrarre il Metal Gear dalla
base americana, ma poi il loro piano venne
scoperto e Matt fu giustiziato dagli
americani. Il padre di Meryl era stato punito
per il crimine di avere creduto nei propri
ideali. In quei tempi difficili, era alto il
prezzo da pagare per avere una propria
coscienza. Nel tumulto della guerra civile
che seguì, il Metal Gear sparì senza lasciare
tracce. Sei mesi prima, tuttavia, era stata
riconfermata la sua esistenza e i Marines
erano stati inviati a recuperare il loro sporco
segreto, perso da tanto tempo.
Dopo avere ascoltato la vera storia da
Gurlukovich, Meryl aveva accettato di
seguire le sue istruzioni e di infiltrarsi tra i
Marines, allo scopo di trasferire il Metal
Gear ai guerriglieri attraverso Gurlukovich,
che ancora forniva sostegno ai ribelli. In
questo modo, lei poteva rendere omaggio
alla memoria di suo padre e agli ideali per
cui era morto.
""È questo ciò che ti ha raccontato
Gurlukovich?"" chiese Snake.
Meryl annuì. Snake scosse la testa.
""Non hai mai pensato che ti stesse
mentendo?""
Meryl guardò Snake con il dolore negli
occhi. ""... Non mi lascerai andare, vero?""
""Cosa hai intenzione di fare?""

estratega despiadado y sin sentimientos.
Durante la Guerra Fría, cuando Campbell
era comandante de FOXHOUND,
Gurlukovich le había humillado en
numerosas ocasiones.
Tras la caída de la Unión Soviética, había
reunido a un grupo de antiguos soldados del
Ejército Rojo y se habían convertido, bajo
su mando, en un ejército de mercenarios.
Desde entonces, Gurlukovich y sus tropas
habían ido de una guerra a otra, vendiendo
sus servicios al mejor postor.
""Hemos recibido un informe que dice que
Gurlukovich y sus hombres han atacado a

Sudamericana de Eldera. Los Marines no
sueltan prenda sobre el tema, para variar.
Pero por lo que hemos conseguido deducir,
parece que tiene algo que ver con Metal
Gear.""
""¿Metal Gear?"" gruñó Snake. Él también
había escuchado rumores al respecto. Tras
el incidente de Shadow Moses, las
características técnicas de Metal Gear
habían sido vendidas en el mercado negro.
Y como resultado, nuevas versiones de
Metal Gear estaban empezando a emerger
por todo el mundo. Eldera era un pequeño
país de Sudamérica, un país inmerso en una
guerra civil. Desde el año 1.980, el país
había estado bajo el mando de un régimen
dictatorial pro americano. Pero al final de la
Guerra Fría y cuando ya la influencia de los
Estados Unidos no estaba tan presente, una
minoría étnica del país se alzó en armas
contra el gobierno para luchar por un país
libre. Desde entonces el país vivía inmerso
en una dura guerra civil, que estaba
destrozándolo. 
Mercenarios y traficantes de armas
entraban y salían de Eldera a su antojo.
Dadas las circunstancias, Campbell se
imaginaba que era muy probable que alguno
de los dos bandos, hubiera podido hacerse
con el nuevo modelo de Metal Gear.
Parecía que había gente que todavía creía
que la amenaza de un ataque nuclear podría
restablecer la estabilidad en la zona.
""¿Y los Marines han ido allí para destruir el
Metal Gear?"" preguntó Snake.
""No. Parece que habían ido allí para intentar
apoderarse de él para su propio uso.
Todavía se conoce muy poco sobre el nuevo
modelo de Metal Gear. Y ésta era una
oportunidad de oro para conseguir más
información.""
En otras palabras, Eldera había conseguido
un nuevo modelo de Metal Gear, los
Marines querían apoderarse de él y
Gurlukovich estaba planeando robárselo a
los Marines. Y ahora Campbell le proponía ir
tras Gurlukovich. Snake negó con la
cabeza. ""Lo siento, pero esta vez vas a
tener que buscar a otro para que haga tu
trabajo sucio. Yo ya paso de los trabajitos
para héroes.""
""Snake...""
""Los tiempos cambian, Coronel. Creo que
ya es hora de que lo dejes.""
""¿Quieres decir que ha llegado la hora de
retirarme del ejército?""
""No, ha llegado la hora de que te olvides de
esa maldita ""vendetta"" contra Gurlukovich.""
La mirada de rabia de Campbell confirmaba
las sospechas de Snake. Campbell seguía
odiando a muerte a Gurlukovich. Para él,
desde la Guerra Fría, Gurlukovich era su
asignatura pendiente. Y el tiempo no había
conseguido atenuar tal odio. Es más, el
tiempo no había hecho sino fomentarlo.
""¿Por eso te incorporaste a la DIA? ¿Para
saldar viejas cuentas?""
""... Sí, tienes razón. Pero no he venido
hasta aquí para pedirte ayuda solamente
por razones personales."" Campbell apretó
sus manos.
""La verdad es que... Meryl formaba parte
de la misión.""

Pero por lo que hemos conseguido deducir,
parece que tiene algo que ver con Metal
Gear.""
""¿Metal Gear?"" gruñó Snake. Él también
había escuchado rumores al respecto. Tras
el incidente de Shadow Moses, las
características técnicas de Metal Gear
habían sido vendidas en el mercado negro.
Y como resultado, nuevas versiones de
Metal Gear estaban empezando a emerger
por todo el mundo. Eldera era un pequeño
país de Sudamérica, un país inmerso en una
guerra civil. Desde el año 1.980, el país
había estado bajo el mando de un régimen
dictatorial pro americano. Pero al final de la
Guerra Fría y cuando ya la influencia de los
Estados Unidos no estaba tan presente, una
minoría étnica del país se alzó en armas
contra el gobierno para luchar por un país
libre. Desde entonces el país vivía inmerso
en una dura guerra civil, que estaba
destrozándolo. 
Mercenarios y traficantes de armas
entraban y salían de Eldera a su antojo.
Dadas las circunstancias, Campbell se
imaginaba que era muy probable que alguno
de los dos bandos, hubiera podido hacerse
con el nuevo modelo de Metal Gear.
Parecía que había gente que todavía creía
que la amenaza de un ataque nuclear podría
restablecer la estabilidad en la zona.
""¿Y los Marines han ido allí para destruir el
Metal Gear?"" preguntó Snake.
""No. Parece que habían ido allí para intentar
apoderarse de él para su propio uso.
Todavía se conoce muy poco sobre el nuevo
modelo de Metal Gear. Y ésta era una
oportunidad de oro para conseguir más
información.""
En otras palabras, Eldera había conseguido
un nuevo modelo de Metal Gear, los
Marines querían apoderarse de él y
Gurlukovich estaba planeando robárselo a
los Marines. Y ahora Campbell le proponía ir
tras Gurlukovich. Snake negó con la
cabeza. ""Lo siento, pero esta vez vas a
tener que buscar a otro para que haga tu
trabajo sucio. Yo ya paso de los trabajitos
para héroes.""
""Snake...""
""Los tiempos cambian, Coronel. Creo que
ya es hora de que lo dejes.""
""¿Quieres decir que ha llegado la hora de
retirarme del ejército?""
""No, ha llegado la hora de que te olvides de
esa maldita ""vendetta"" contra Gurlukovich.""
La mirada de rabia de Campbell confirmaba
las sospechas de Snake. Campbell seguía
odiando a muerte a Gurlukovich. Para él,
desde la Guerra Fría, Gurlukovich era su
asignatura pendiente. Y el tiempo no había
conseguido atenuar tal odio. Es más, el
tiempo no había hecho sino fomentarlo.
""¿Por eso te incorporaste a la DIA? ¿Para
saldar viejas cuentas?""
""... Sí, tienes razón. Pero no he venido
hasta aquí para pedirte ayuda solamente
por razones personales."" Campbell apretó
sus manos.
""La verdad es que... Meryl formaba parte
de la misión.""

La barca de goma se estaba acercando ya
al tanque. Snake agarró la cuerda con
fuerza. Meryl Silverburg. La sobrina de
Campbell. La mujer que junto a Snake, se
había jugado la vida en el incidente de
Shadow Moses. Durante un tiempo, habían
vivido juntos. Pero hacía seis meses que
Meryl le había dejado. Dijo que tenía que
ocuparse de algo muy importante. Su voz
era firme y segura. Sus ojos claros y fríos
como el acero. Snake no consiguió hacerla
cambiar de opinión.
|
Snake trepó por la cuerda por el casco
externo del tanque y salió a la cubierta de
popa. Cerca, podía ver a varios soldados
que patrullaban el lugar. Parecían ser
mercenarios rusos. Llamó a Campbell por el
Codec.
""Aquí Snake. He conseguido infiltrarme en
el tanque. Parece que nuestros amigos
rusos ya han conseguido tomar control del
tanque. Voy a intentar ponerme en contacto
con Meryl de alguna forma.""#C0

""¿Qué estás haciendo aquí?""
""He venido a verte,"" contestó Snake.
""¿Te crees gracioso, no?""
""Pues mira, no es del todo broma.""
""... Te ha enviado mi tío, ¿verdad?""
Snake asintió. Le explicó que Campbell se
había enterado del ataque de Gurlukovich. ""¡
Qué morro tienes viniendo aquí!"" dijo Meryl.
""Pues mira quién fue a hablar,"" contestó
Snake.
""¡¿Qué?!""
""Colarte en otro país simulando que se trata
de una operación militar cuando lo único
que quieres es robar el Metal Gear. ¿Quién
crees que tiene el morro de venir aquí?"" Su
voz cobró un tono algo condenatorio. ""¿Esto
es eso ""tan importante"" que tenías que
hacer?""
""... Tú no lo entenderías."" Meryl se dio la
vuelta. ""Alguien como tú, que felizmente se
pasaría el resto de su vida cuidando de
perros que tiran de trineos, no podría
entenderlo nunca.""
""Lo único que pretendía era llevar una vida
en la que no existiera el odio.""
""No. Lo que pasa es que querías evadir la
realidad, eso es todo. Querías olvidarte de
todo, de la sociedad, de tu pasado... incluso
de mí.""
""¿... Por eso me dejaste?""
""No, no fue por eso..."" Pero los ojos de
Meryl le decían lo contrario. Se produjo un
violento silencio. Tras seis meses de
separación se habían creado distancias
difíciles de acortar. Por fin Meryl rompió el
silencio. ""... Mi padre... murió aquí, en este
país,"" murmuró ella.
Matt Campbell, el padre de Meryl y el
hermano pequeño de Campbell, también fue
un agente de la DIA. Snake había
escuchado rumores que decían que
desapareció durante una misión cuando
Meryl era todavía una niña.
""Quería ver con mis propios ojos lo que vio
mi padre..."" Meryl miró por la ventana,
aunque tras ella sólo se podía ver la
tormenta. De repente se giró hacia Snake y
le dijo.
""Snake por favor, vete de aquí. Ésta es mi
batalla personal. No necesito que nadie de
fuera se vea implicado en esto.""
""Demasiado tarde para eso. Ya estoy
implicado.""
""¿Y nada puede hacerte cambiar de
opinión?""
""Nada,"" dijo Snake con firmeza.
Meryl suspiró exasperada. Snake hizo como
que no se dio cuenta.
""Bueno, ahora cuéntame cómo van las
cosas por aquí. Esta misión debía de ser
top-secret, ¿no? ¿Y entonces cómo se ha
enterado Gurlukovich?""
""Eso me gustaría saber a mí también.""
""¿Crees que hay algún infiltrado?""
""Lo dudo. Pero bueno, después de todo ¿no
te has enterado tú? Entonces cualquiera
podría hacerlo.""
Snake se quedó pensativo durante un rato.
Meryl tenía razón, cualquiera podía haberse
enterado. Pero de todas las formas tenían
que evitar que Gurlukovich se apoderara del
Metal Gear.
""¿Dónde está el Metal Gear?""
""En el almacén de carga.""
""Vale. Voy hacia allí a comprobarlo. Tú...""
Meryl le interrumpió. ""Eh, yo no voy a
acatar tus órdenes. Nos separamos y cada
uno vamos por nuestro lado. Si quieres ir al
almacén de carga, entonces tendré que
ocuparme de esas cajas que están
bloqueando las escaleras de la primera

almacén de carga.
En el almacén de carga predominaba la
imagen de un objeto de gran dimensión
cubierto por una lona. No había ninguna
duda, era el Metal Gear, la mejor arma del
siglo 21.
Tras cerciorarse de que no había nadie,
Snake se aproximó al Metal Gear. Su gran
sombra le cubrió por completo. Levantó la
lona para echar un vistazo. Pero, para su
sorpresa, bajo la lona sólo vio un obús
decrépito. El baño de la armadura tenía
motas de óxido. Y el polvo recubría todo el

anticuado, y tenía pequeñas grietas por

detrás del pilar. Era Meryl. La acercó hacia

Snake observó como el cañón iba dibujando
el contorno de su esbelto y blanquísimo
cuello hasta llegar a la comisura de sus
labios. Snake soltó su pistola.
""Una buena decisión,"" dijo Gurlukovich.

Meryl, tras un forcejeo, consiguió liberarse
de las garras de Gurlukovich. Gurlukovich
apuntó con su pistola a Snake. Miró a Meryl
lascivamente. De repente, Snake se dio

parar al suelo, justo entre los pies de
Snake. ""¡Teníamos un trato! ¡Me prometiste

Durante la Guerra Fría, cuando el país
todavía estaba bajo el control de un dictador
pro americano, el ejército americano estaba
llevando a cabo una operación top-secret en
Eldera. Matt Campbell era un miembro de
ese proyecto. Cuando se acabó la Guerra
Fría, también se dio por finalizado dicho
proyecto, y por lo tanto los americanos se
prepararon para abandonar el país. Matt, sin
embargo, desapareció en combate. Poco
después, el régimen pro americano, sin el
apoyo que América le ofrecía, se tuvo que
enfrentar a levantamientos de grupos
minoritarios del país. En Eldera estalló una
guerra civil. Poco después se encontró el
cadáver de Matt. Spetznaz estaba detrás de
aquel levantamiento. Y el nombre de su
comandante era Sergei Gurlukovich. ""Hay
quien dice que Matt estaba colaborando con
Gurlukovich. Pero yo no me lo creo.""

fue precisamente Gurlukovich quien asesinó
a Matt.

odio engendraba odio.
""¿Tú también estabas involucrado en ese

tanto tiempo. Tras escuchar la historia que
Gurlukovich le contó, Meryl accedió a seguir
sus instrucciones y se infiltró en los
Marines. Su intención era transferir el Metal
Gear a las guerrillas a través de
Gurlukovich, que continuaba ayudando a los
rebeldes. De esta forma, ella podría revivir
los sueños e ideales de su padre, ideales
que le costaron la vida.
""¿Eso es lo que te ha contado
Gurlukovich?"" preguntó Snake.
Meryl asintió. Snake meneó su cabeza.
""¿Y no se te ha ocurrido pensar que
probablemente te estuviera mintiendo?""
Meryl miró a Snake con pena en sus ojos.
""... No vas a dejar que me escape,
¿verdad...?""
""¿Y qué vas a hacer?""
Meryl sacó su pistola y apuntó a Snake.
""No me vas a disparar,"" dijo Snake.
Ella soltó el seguro de su pistola con el
pulgar.
""Mira y verás.""#C0

entrecortada... y sus heridas eran mortales.

pecho, cubriendo las heridas que él mismo
le había causado. Notó como su cuerpo se
enfriaba y como la vida se le escapaba.#C0

0x644f1,"""Yo que tú no me preocuparía demasiado

detrás. Era Gurlukovich. Tenía una pistola
en la mano.
""¿Por qué estabas utilizando a Meryl?""
preguntó Snake, intentando controlar su
rabia.
""¿UTILIZÁNDOLA yo? Sólo le dije lo que
ella quería escuchar.""
""No me lo creo.""
Una breve sonrisa se dibujó en el rostro de
Gurlukovich. Era la sonrisa de un gran
estratega, una sonrisa que mentía,
manipulaba y traicionaba. ""Puede que haya
adornado un poco la verdad. Después de
todo, la gente cree en lo que quiere creer.""
""¿Es así como piensas vengarte del
Coronel?""
""Por supuesto. Se merece sufrir. Haré todo
lo posible para que su agonía sea inmensa,
y su dolor sea tan grande como el
sufrimiento de todos esos hombres que tuve
que enterrar y el sufrimiento de sus viudas y
huérfanos.""
Gurlukovich odiaba a Campbell. Campbell
odiaba a Gurlukovich. El odio engendraba
odio.
""Y por eso la elegí a ella. ¿No es ella la
persona más importante en la vida de
Campbell? Eso lo dijo Matt, cuando se
estaba muriendo...""
""¿Así que tú mataste a Matt?""
Los ojos de Gurlukovich se oscurecieron
durante un instante. ""Veo que mi reputación
me precede. Simplemente le di lo que él
tanto deseaba. Estaba esperando que
alguien le matara. Él era de esa clase de
hombres."" Durante un momento, pareció
que Gurlukovich realmente estaba apenado
por la pérdida de un viejo amigo. Igual su
dolor era real. Pero esa mirada se
desvaneció muy pronto.
""No le voy a dar el Metal Gear a las
guerrillas de Eldera. Mis hombres y yo
tenemos otros planes. Puede que el aparato
en sí sea un montón de chatarra, pero lo
que nosotros realmente queremos recuperar
son las cabezas nucleares y su sistema de
lanzamiento. Incluso en el día de hoy, un
misil balístico nuclear sigue siendo algo muy
preciado.""
Snake apretó los dientes. Gurlukovich se
rió.
""No te enfades conmigo. Al fin y al cabo, es
la última voluntad de Matt Campbell. Ésa
era su intención desde el principio.""
""¿Qué quieres decir?""
""Si a mí no me crees, pregúntaselo a él
mismo.""
Gurlukovich apuntó a Snake con su pistola
""¡En el infierno!""

El tanque y el Metal Gear que el tanque

The offshore decontamination facility 
was selected as the setting for a 
top-secret joint exercise between the 
Navy SEALs and Dead Cell due to its 
complex structure and isolated 
environment. During the exercise, 
Dead Cell and a team under their 
command portrayed terrorists, while 
the SEAL team acted to suppress them.
|
Dead Cell was a specialized naval 
combat team feared for their brutality. 
Their main function was anti-terrorist 
training, launching unannounced 
assaults on important government 
installations to determine their level of 
security. Although famous for the 
ferocity of their attacks, there was 
another reason for their reputation. It 
was rumored that their anti-terrorist 
training was cover for their true 
mission: operating above the law to 
undermine threats to American 
national interests. Whether inside the 
country or out, whenever anti-American 
sentiment was suspiciously crushed or 
leaders died unnatural deaths, military 
insiders inevitably associated Dead 
Cell's name with the act. The rumors 
were never confirmed. However, that 
the name of Dead Cell had become 
equated with death, disaster, and 
calamity was undeniable. Until one 
year ago....
|
One year ago, Dead Cell commander 
Colonel Jackson was arrested on 
charges of graft and corruption. From 
that point on, the overzealous tactics 
during attacks, the shady pasts of the 
team members, and their combined 
inhumanity made Dead Cell's name 
synonymous with military corruption 
and dishonor. Even their very fighting 
ability had come under question. This 
exercise marked their first official 
assignment in some time, but only 
Dead Cell leader Vamp was granted 
permission to participate.
|
The joint exercises were drawing to a 
close. I was guarding my assigned 
area in Strut F. Immediately after 
receiving a report that half of the 
terrorists had been subdued, a coded 
transmission signifying an emergency 
situation came through my Codec.
""...Come in, anyone! This is Alpha 
team. We're under attack!""
""This is Pliskin. What happened?!"" 
I replied.
""...Dead Cell... it's Vamp! 
He double-crossed.... The team is 
almost... by him....""
I could hear screams and the sound of 
gunfire in the background. ""What is 
your location?"" I asked.
""Strut B....""
I heard a scream, and the line went 
dead.
I immediately punched in a different 
frequency. A low voice answered:
""This is Dolph. Is this Snake?""
It was Marine Commander Scott Dolph.
He was in Big Shell as part of the 
exercise. 
I explained the situation to Dolph. 
He answered through a burst of noise:
""Looks like things just started on my 
end too. ""
""What's the status?""
""There was an explosion in the Shell 2 
Core. B1's almost totally flooded.""
""...Is this what you were worried 
about?""
Three days ago, I accepted a request 
from Dolph to join the exercise. Dolph 
was worried something might happen, 
and he asked me to put a stop to it if 
it did. But he didn't say why. All he 
told me was, ""I'm counting on you.""
Dolph and Dead Cell were connected.  
Dolph's daughter Helena was 
Jackson's wife. When Jackson was 
arrested, Dolph was the only one who 
defended Dead Cell and Jackson. As 
a result, he risked his own position. 
Dolph seemed to be worried about 
something concerning Dead Cell.  
I accepted without any questions. 
I owed Dolph.

Dolph created a fake identity for me. 
And here I was, along for the exercise 
as Lieutenant Junior Grade Pliskin. I 
then asked him: ""What is Vamp up to?""
""I have no idea...."" Dolph said in a 
deeply troubled voice.
""Snake, we must figure out what's 
happening. We're trapped in the north 
part of Filter Chamber No. 2 by debris 
and flooding. Looks like it'll take us 
some time to get out of here. I want you
to rescue the SEALs. Head over to 
Strut B.""
""Roger that.""

0x66808,"I was greeted at Strut B by the sight of 
a total massacre. The bodies of dead 
SEALs littered the entire area. 
Everything had been torn apart and 
splattered with blood. I heard a moan 
coming from a body in a pool of blood.
""Hold on!""
I ran over and lifted the soldier in my 
arms. He was still breathing, but his 
wound was deep, reaching his internal 
organs. It was clear that he wouldn't 
make it. He looked at me with 
unfocused eyes.
""It was Vamp.... He called it a 
'lynching'.... revenge for those who 
backstabbed Jackson. He called... the 
bribery charge... a sham...""
""You'd better not talk now,"" I said, 
trying to quiet him.
But he kept on talking.
""Vamp's going after Captain O'Brien... 
but that's nonsense. There's no way 
the Captain's involved... He's just... 
not like that.""
Naval Captain O'Brien, multiply 
decorated in the Persian Gulf, Europe, 
and Africa, was commander in chief for 
the entire exercise. The mass media 
praised the Captain as a competent 
and noble-minded military man who is 
well-liked by his fellow soldiers.
He grabbed my chest. His grip was 
surprisingly strong for a man on his 
deathbed. 
""The Captain is... on the first floor of 
the Shell 2 Core.... Save the Captain! 
Please....""
His body lost its strength. I closed his 
eyes. That was all I could do for him.
I contacted Dolph, telling him what I'd 
just heard.
""I see...."" mumbled Dolph.
His voice didn't sound surprised at all. 
In fact, he sounded like he'd just 
confirmed some bad news. 
""Did you know about this?"" I asked.
He became quiet, answering hesitantly.
""There've been a lot of cases involving 
murdered government employees and 
servicemen lately. Rumor has it Vamp 
is behind it all.""
""Is Jackson really innocent?""
""I don't know for sure, but perhaps. He 
was a real proud soldier. He was not 
the corrupt kind.""
""You think O'Brien backstabbed 
Jackson?""
""No, I don't think so. I know his 
reputation....""
""How can you be so sure?""
""It was O'Brien who planned this 
training. If he was involved in Jackson's
case, there's no way he would involve 
Vamp.""
""That's only if O'Brien knew of the 
rumors of the lynching, right?""
""He knew.""
""Are you sure?""
""Oh yeah. I heard of the rumors from 
O'Brien.""
""...You and O'Brien talked about the 
rumors?""
I was a bit surprised. O'Brien and 
Dolph... political Navy captain and 
head of the Marines. They didn't seem 
like a likely pair of friends. 
Dolph answered as if he knew of my 
doubts.
""O'Brien and I didn't always get along 
because of our positions. I don't think 
he liked me either. But I don't think he 
hated me so much that he wouldn't give 
me advice that would save my life.""
""What do you mean?""
""O'Brien came to warn me -- that I was 
Vamp's next target.""
I then knew the true reason Dolph had 
participated in this exercise.
""So you tried to rid Dead Cell of its 
infamous rumors by revealing yourself 
to Vamp....""
""Correct. If nothing happened to me 
during the exercise, I could prove that 
the rumors were false.""
""...You do trust Vamp.""
Dolph scoffed.
""I wouldn't go that far. If I trusted him 
completely, I wouldn't have called you....
I'm a coward.""
I said to him that trusting something or 
someone isn't that easy. Dolph did not 
respond. I then asked him. ""But then 
it's not you but O'Brien that Vamp's 
after?""
""Yeah.... Either O'Brien's information 
was wrong or Vamp's wrong...""
It seemed Dolph was confused too.
""The only thing that's certain is that 
Vamp is trying to kill O'Brien.... Snake, 
you've got to stop Vamp.""
""Got it.""
I considered the structure of Big Shell 
again. I'd need to use the Shell 1 - 2 
connecting bridge from Strut D to get 
to Shell 2, where Vamp should be 
heading. That meant I'd have to head 
for Strut D first.#C0

""...You do trust Vamp.""
Dolph scoffed.
""I wouldn't go that far. If I trusted him 
completely, I wouldn't have called you....
I'm a coward.""
I said to him that trusting something or 
someone isn't that easy. Dolph did not 
respond. I then asked him. ""But then 
it's not you but O'Brien that Vamp's 
after?""
""Yeah.... Either O'Brien's information 
was wrong or Vamp's wrong...""
It seemed Dolph was confused too.
""The only thing that's certain is that 
Vamp is trying to kill O'Brien.... Snake, 
you've got to stop Vamp.""
""Got it.""
I considered the structure of Big Shell 
again. I'd need to use the Shell 1 - 2 
connecting bridge from Strut D to get 
to Shell 2, where Vamp should be 
heading. That meant I'd have to head 
for Strut D first.#C0

O'Brien had sealed off the door to the 
Shell 1 - 2 connecting bridge from 
Strut D to prevent Vamp from getting 
through. He'd also reorganized the 
surviving SEALs to defend Strut G. 
Dolph said:
""Snake, join the SEALs. Vamp is the 
enemy. Those men might be SEALs, 
but I doubt they can stop him on their 
own."" 
""But how can I get to Shell 2? The 
Shell 1 - 2 connecting bridge is closed 
off.""

oil fence in the lower part of Big Shell.

able to get to Strut L of Shell 2 by

the sound of gunfire from above. It

SEALs fighting Vamp. But it wasn't a

massacre. Vamp ran. The SEALs fired.

threw knives. Some of the men went 
down. Other SEALs fought back. Vamp 
wove and dodged. He slit the throats

exploded. It must have been wired up 
with bombs beforehand. A series of

next to Vamp and repeated the question.

Vamp turned away. Dolph took Vamp's 
face in both hands and brought it to 
face forward again.
""I'm going to ask him myself anyway. 
Was it Jackson?!""
Vamp knocked Dolph's hands away.
""Yes...."" 
Vamp said as he was coughing up 
blood, ""The Captain blamed himself all 
the way. He was determined to find a 
way to restore Dead Cell and its honor. 
That's all he talked about in jail -- day 
after day, as if he were possessed. 
One day he called on me. About this 
'lynching.' ""
Vamp's face twitched. I didn't think he 
was doing it from the pain.
""There was no sign of the brilliant 
Captain I had known. He was on the 
edge. Or perhaps he had already gone 
over.... There was nothing I could do 
but obey.""
""...So Jackson ordered you to do 
this?"" I asked.
""...No. It was all me. I had to end it. 
Because he had found out....""
""He?""
""O'Brien.""
Vamp continued.
Somehow, O'Brien had discovered that 
Jackson had been behind the ""lynching.""
So O'Brien had demanded that Vamp be 
placed under his command as a 
member of Dead Cell. Vamp saw 
through O'Brien's plan: strengthening 
his authority by showing the military he 
could control the problematic Dead 
Cell, while expanding his powers by 
taking charge of the extra-legal 
operations team. Vamp refused. Dead 
Cell would not be used as a tool of the 
government. So O'Brien threatened to 
expose the fact that Jackson was 
ordering Vamp to carry out the murders. 
And if he had, Dead Cell's name would 
have been tainted for good. That was 
how O'Brien did things. The only path 
left open to Vamp was to kill O'Brien. 
Vamp pretended to go along so that he 
could kill him during the exercise. He 
couldn't fake an accident. It would be a 
revolt. Dead Cell would be dissolved, 
and he would probably die. But it was 
better than selling his own pride. 
Dolph exploded.
""Nonsense! If he wanted it, you should 
have given him Dead Cell! You didn't 
have to throw your life away for that! 
Why did you do this?""
Vamp looked away. Watching him, 
Dolph seemed to notice something.
""...There's something else, isn't there?""
Paralyzed by Dolph's gaze, Vamp 
spoke as if defeated.
""O'Brien dragged his political enemy 
into this exercise. O'Brien ordered me 
to kill this political enemy... you, Scott, 
as proof that I should be under his 
command.... But that was the last thing
I wanted to do....""
Dolph mumbled in shock, ""That's 
crazy....""
Vamp looked at me with pleading eyes.
""Now, kill me. There's nothing left in 
this world that I want to see.""
""No way. I don't take orders from you,"" 
I said.
Vamp hung his head. I continued.

make the people who care about you 
any sadder than you already have.""

""Je ne pouvais rien dire...""

C'était Dolph. Il avait dû entendre le bruit de
la bataille et nous avait trouvés. 
Vamp ne répondit pas. Dolph s'agenouilla à
côté de Vamp et reposa sa question.

""Il n'y a qu'une personne que tu essaies de
protéger. Est-ce Jackson ?""

Vamp se détourna. Dolph prit le visage de
Vamp dans ses mains pour l'obliger à le
regarder.

""Je lui demanderai de toute manière. Est-ce
Jackson !?""

Vamp repoussa les mains de Dolph.

""Oui...."" Vamp cracha du sang en
répondant. 
""Le Capitaine s'en voulait profondément. Il
avait résolu de sauver la Dead Cell et son
honneur. C'est tout ce dont il parlait en
prison - jour après jour, comme un
possédé. Un jour, il m'implora.
Pour le « lynchage ».""
Son visage se contracta. Je ne crois pas
que c'était la douleur.
""Il ne restait plus rien du brillant capitaine
que j'avais connu. Il était à cran. Peut-être
même qu'il avait déjà disjoncté... Je ne
pouvais rien faire qu'obéir.""

""... Alors Jackson t'a ordonné de faire ça ?""
demandai-je.

""... Non. C'était moi. Il fallait en finir. Parce
qu'il avait découvert...""

""Il ?""

""O'Brien.""

Vamp poursuivit.
O'Brien avait découvert que Jackson était
derrière le « lynchage ». Alors O'Brien avait
demandé à ce que Vamp soit placé sous
ses ordres comme membre de la Dead Cell.
Vamp comprit le plan d'O'Brien : renforcer
son autorité en montrant à l'armée qu'il
pouvait contrôler la Dead Cell
problématique, tout en élargissant ses
fonctions en se chargeant de l'équipe
d'opérations non officielles. Vamp refusa. La
Dead Cell ne deviendrait pas un outil du
gouvernement. Alors O'Brien le menaça de
révéler que Jackson ordonnait à Vamp
d'exécuter les meurtres. Auquel cas le nom
de la Dead Cell aurait été irrémédiablement
terni. Telle était la tactique d'O'Brien.

Vamp n'avait d'autre solution que de tuer
O'Brien. Vamp prétendit le suivre pour
pouvoir le tuer pendant l'exercice. Ce ne
serait pas un accident. Ce serait une
révolte. La Dead Cell serait dissoute et il
mourrait probablement. Mais il valait mieux
ça que vendre sa fierté. 
Dolph explosa.

""C'est stupide ! S'il voulait la Dead Cell, il
fallait la lui donner ! Tu n'avais pas à
mettre toute ta vie en l'air pour ça !
Pourquoi ne l'as-tu pas fait ?""

Vamp regarda ailleurs. Dolph l'observait. Il
sembla remarquer quelque chose.

""... Il y a autre chose, hein ?""

Sous l'emprise du regard de Dolph, Vamp
se mit à parler.

""O'Brien a attiré son ennemi politique dans
l'exercice. Il m'a ordonné de tuer son
ennemi politique, toi... Scott, pour prouver
que je devais être sous ses ordres... Mais
c'était la dernière chose que je voulais...""

Sidéré, Dolph grommela :

""C'est dingue...""

Vamp me regarda d'un air implorant.

""Tue-moi maintenant. Je ne veux plus rien
voir de ce monde.""

""Pas question. Je ne suis pas sous tes
ordres,"" dis-je.

Vamp baissa la tête. Je poursuivis.

""... Je crois que tu dois vivre. Ne fais pas
souffrir les gens pour qui tu comptes plus
que tu ne l'as déjà fait.""

riskierte er seine eigene Position. Dolphs
Sorgen schienen in einem Zusammenhang

vor. Die Körper toter SEALs waren über den
gesamten Bereich verstreut. Alles war
kaputt und blutbespritzt. Ich hörte, wie ein
Soldat stöhnte, der in einer Blutlache lag.

""Warte!""

Ich rannte zu dem Soldaten und zog ihn in
meine Arme hoch. Er atmete noch, hatte
aber eine tiefe Wunde, die bis zu den
inneren Organen ging. Es war klar, dass er
nicht überleben würde. Er sah mich mit
stumpfem Blick an.
""Das war Vamp... Er sprach von einer
'Lynchrache'... an denjenigen, die Jackson
in den Rücken gefallen wären. Er
bezeichnete...den Bestechungsvorwurf... als
eine einzige Lüge...""

""Du solltest jetzt lieber nicht reden"", sagte
ich, um ihn zu beruhigen.

Aber er sprach immer weiter.
""Vamp ist auf Kapitän O'Brien aus... Aber
das ist Unsinn. Der Kapitän hängt da auf
keinen Fall drin... So einer... ist er einfach
nicht.""

Kapitän zur See O'Brien, mehrfach im
Persischen Golf, in Europa und Afrika
ausgezeichnet, war der Oberbefehlshaber
der gesamten Übung. In den Massenmedien
wurde der Kapitän als kompetenter,
vorbildlicher Militär gelobt, der bei seinen
Soldaten hoch angesehen war.

Er packte mich am Oberkörper. Für
jemanden, der im Sterben lag, hatte er
einen erstaunlich festen Griff.

Kern von Shell 2... Rette den Kapitän!

Dann waren seine Kräfte am Ende. Ich
drückte seine Augenlider zu. Mehr konnte
ich für ihn jetzt nicht tun.

ihm, was ich soeben gehört hatte.

Er schien überhaupt nicht überrascht zu
sein. Vielmehr klang es so, als hätte er jetzt
Gewissheit zu schlechten Nachrichten.

""Wussten Sie davon?"" fragte ich.

Er wurde still und antwortete stockend.
""In letzter Zeit hat es viele Fälle gegeben, in
denen Regierungsmitarbeiter und
Militärangehörige ermordet wurden.
Gerüchten zufolge soll Vamp hinter allem
stecken.""

""Ist Jackson wirklich unschuldig?""

""Ich weiß es nicht sicher, aber vielleicht. Er
war ein echt stolzer Soldat. Nicht von der
korrupten Art.""

""Meinen Sie, O'Brien ist Jackson in den
Rücken gefallen?""

""Nein, das glaube ich nicht. Ich kenne
seinen Ruf...""

""Wie können Sie da so sicher sein?""

""O'Brien hat doch dieses Training geplant.
Wenn er im Fall Jackson drinhinge, hätte er
auf keinen Fall Vamp einbezogen.""

""Das gilt aber nur, wenn O'Brien von den
Lynchgerüchten wusste, richtig?""

""Er wusste davon.""

""Sind Sie sicher?""

""Aber ja. Ich habe die Gerüchte doch von
O'Brien gehört.""

""... Sie und O'Brien haben über die
Gerüchte gesprochen?""

Ich war etwas überrascht. O'Brien und
Dolph... ein politischer Navy-Kapitän und der
Chef der Marines. Das schien kein
glückliches Paar zu sein.

Dolph antwortete, als ob er meine Zweifel
ahnte.

""O'Brien und ich sind aufgrund unserer
Positionen nicht immer gut miteinander
ausgekommen. Ich glaube auch nicht, dass
er mich sonderlich mochte. Ich glaube aber
auch nicht, dass er mich so sehr hasste,
dass er keinen Ratschlag gegeben hätte,
wenn dieser Ratschlag mein Leben hätte
retten können.""

""Was meinen Sie damit?""

""O'Brien hat mich gewarnt - ich
wäre Vamps nächstes Ziel.""

Da wusste ich, warum Dolph wirklich an
dieser Übung teilnahm.

""Sie wollten Dead Cell von den schlimmen
Gerüchten befreien, indem Sie sich Vamp
offenbarten...""

""Genau. Wenn mir während der Übung
nichts zustieße, könnte ich beweisen, dass
die Gerüchte falsch waren.""

""... Sie vertrauen doch Vamp.""

Dolph spottete über sich selbst.

""So weit würde ich nicht gehen. Wenn ich
ihm völlig vertraut hätte, hätte ich Sie nicht
gerufen.... Ich bin ein Feigling.""

Ich sagte ihm, dass es nicht einfach wäre,
einer Sache oder Person zu vertrauen.

""Aber Vamp ist nicht auf Sie aus, sondern

Kugeln trafen ihn nicht. Vamp warf Messer.

weiter. Vamp bewegte sich schnell hin und

Als ich mich umdrehte, kreuzte sich mein

gefallen und auf der Seite von Shell 2

seiner langen Zunge an einem Messer und
schleuderte es auf mich.
Und dann verschwand er in das Innere

kletterte etwa 40 Meter hinunter. Als ich
endlich am Ölzaun war, hörte ich von oben
Schüsse knallen. Sie kamen von der
Verbindungsbrücke zwischen Shell 1 und 2.
Ich konnte sehen, wie die SEALs gegen
Vamp kämpften. Aber es war kein normales
Gefecht. Es war ein einseitiges Massaker.
Vamp rannte. Die SEALs feuerten. Aber die
Kugeln trafen ihn nicht. Vamp warf Messer.
Manche SEALs fielen, andere kämpften
weiter. Vamp bewegte sich schnell hin und
her und wich aus. Er schnitt den SEALs die
Kehle durch, schlitzte ihnen den Bauch auf
und stach ihnen tief ins Herz. In
Sekundenbruchteilen waren die SEALs
erledigt. Ich sah, wie der letzte Mann den
völlig unverletzten Vamp anschrie. Plötzlich
explodierte die Verbindungsbrücke.
Wahrscheinlich waren dort schon vorher
Bomben gelegt worden. Mehrere
Explosionen hüllten die Verbindungsbrücke
in Flammen und sie begann tosend
zusammenzubrechen. Trümmer regneten
auf das Meer herab. Ich flüchtete über den
Ölzaun. Eine große Wassersäule schoss
hinter mir hoch. Wellen schlugen hoch und
warfen den Ölzaun mit jeder Woge hoch.

""Er?""

""O'Brien.""

Vamp sprach weiter.

Irgendwie hatte O'Brien entdeckt, dass
Jackson hinter dem ""Lynchen"" steckte. Da
hatte O'Brien gefordert, dass ihm Vamp als
Teammitglied von Dead Cell unterstellt
würde. Vamp durchschaute O'Briens
Plan: Er wollte seine Autorität stärken,
indem er dem Militär zeigte, dass er das
problematische Dead-Cell-Team unter
Kontrolle halten konnte, und gleichzeitig
würde er seine Macht ausdehnen, indem
er die Verantwortung für das außerhalb
der Legalität operierende Team
übernahm. Vamp lehnte ab. Dead Cell
sollte nicht als Werkzeug der Regierung
benutzt werden. Da drohte O'Brien, die
Tatsache preiszugeben, dass Jackson Vamp
befohlen hatte, die Morde auszuführen.
Der Name von Dead Cell wäre dann
für immer befleckt gewesen. Das war
O'Briens Vorgehensweise.

Vamp blieb nur ein Weg - er musste O'Brien
töten. Vamp lenkte scheinbar ein, so dass
er ihn während der Übung töten könnte. Er
konnte keinen Unfall vortäuschen. Es würde
eine Revolte sein. Dead Cell würde
aufgelöst werden und er selbst
wahrscheinlich umkommen. Aber das war
besser als seinen eigenen Stolz zu
verkaufen.

Dolph explodierte.

""Unsinn! Wenn er es so wollte, hätten Sie
diesem Burschen Dead Cell geben sollen!
Dafür mussten Sie Ihr Leben nicht
wegwerfen! Warum haben Sie nicht so
gehandelt?""

Vamp schaute weg. Dolph beobachtete ihn
und schien etwas zu bemerken.

""... Da ist noch etwas, nicht wahr?""

Von Dolphs starrem Blick gelähmt sprach
Vamp wie ein Besiegter.

""O'Brien zog seinen politischen Feind in
diese Übung hinein. O'Brien befahl mir,
diesen politischen Feind zu töten, Sie...
Scott, als Beweis dafür, dass ich ihm
untergeben war... Aber das war das Letzte,
wozu ich bereit gewesen wäre...""

Dolph murmelte schockiert:

""Das ist Wahnsinn...""

Vamp sah mich mit bittenden Augen an.

""Töte mich jetzt. In dieser Welt gibt es
nichts mehr, was ich sehen möchte.""

""Keinesfalls. Ich nehme keine Befehle von
dir entgegen"", sagte ich.

Vamp ließ den Kopf hängen. Ich sprach
weiter.

""... Ich glaube vielmehr, dass du am Leben
bleiben solltest. Mache die Menschen, die
sich um dich sorgen, nicht noch trauriger als
du schon bist.""

""Danke..."" sagte Dolph.#C0
","Vamp stöhnte.

""Ich könnte nichts sagen..."" 
""War es Jackson?"" fragte jemand. Es war
Dolph. Er musste den Kampf gehört und uns
gefunden haben.

Vamp gab keine Antwort. Dolph kniete sich
neben Vamp hin und wiederholte die Frage.

""Es gibt nur eine Person, die Sie schützen
wollen. Ist es Jackson?""

Vamp wendete sich ab. Dolph nahm Vamps
Kopf in beide Hände und drehte ihn
geradeaus.

""Ich werde ihn sowieso selber fragen. War
es Jackson!?""

Vamp stieß Dolphs Hände weg.

""Ja...""
Vamp bejahte die Frage, während er Blut
hustete.

""Der Kapitän gab sich ständig die Schuld.
Er war entschlossen, eine Möglichkeit zu
finden, Dead Cell und seine Ehre
wiederherzustellen. Nur darüber sprach er in
der Haft - tagein tagaus, als ob er
besessen wäre. Eines Tages sprach er mich
an. Wegen dieses 'Lynchens'.""
Vamps Gesicht zuckte. Ich glaube nicht,
dass es wegen seiner Schmerzen war.

""Keine Spur mehr von dem brillanten
Kapitän, den ich gekannt hatte. Er war
nervös. Oder vielleicht war er schon
verrückt geworden ... Da konnte ich nur
gehorchen.""

""... Jackson hat dir also den Befehl dazu
gegeben?"" fragte ich.

""... Nein. Es kam alles von mir. Ich musste
es zu Ende bringen. Weil er es
herausgefunden hatte...""

famosa per la ferocia dei suoi attacchi, ma

soppresso in modo sospetto il sentimento
antiamericano o che alcuni leader morivano
di morte cruenta, i militari più al dentro della

Dead Cell diventò sinonimo di morte, disastri

andato a pezzi ed era schizzato di sangue.

ferita profonda, che raggiungeva gli organi
interni. Era chiaro che non ce l'avrebbe
fatta. Mi guardò con occhi appannati.

capitano politico della Marina e il capo dei

affiatata al punto di parlare di queste cose.

All'improvviso, il ponte di collegamento
esplose. Dovevano averci piazzato delle
bombe prima. Il ponte, avviluppato dalle
fiamme generate da una serie di esplosioni,
iniziò a precipitare con un rombo. I detriti
piovvero sulla superficie del mare.
Attraversai di corsa la barriera antipetrolio,
mentre alle mie spalle si formava un'enorme
colonna d'acqua. L'acqua si agitò, lanciando
in alto la barriera ad ogni ondata. A fatica
arrivai alla parte inferiore del Supporto L. Mi
voltai e incrociai lo sguardo di Vamp, che si
era gettato dal cielo ed era atterrato sul lato
di Shell 2. Vamp sogghignò, leccò un
coltello con la sua lingua lunga e lo scagliò
contro di me, dopo di che sparì all'interno
del Supporto G.
Risalii la scaletta e arrivai nel Supporto L di
Shell 2. Vamp era già penetrato in Shell 2.
O'Brien era in pericolo. Mi misi a correre
verso il centro di Shell 2.#C0

sentivano colpi d'arma da fuoco e non

agitazione. Il Codec suonò: era Dolph.
""Snake, qual è la tua posizione?""
""Proprio sopra la sua testa. Sono appena
entrato nel primo piano del centro di
Shell 2.

""Ho perso il contatto.""
Feci schioccare la lingua. Eravamo arrivati
troppo tardi?

sembrava troppo sicuro.

Sala di depurazione dell'aria. Mi ha detto

impedire a Vamp di entrarvi.""

era vivo o morto: andare dentro.

Allora O'Brien minacciò di dire che Jackson
stava ordinando a Vamp di compiere gli
omicidi. Se lo avesse fatto, il nome di Dead
Cell sarebbe rimasto macchiato per sempre.
È così che aveva agito O'Brien.
Per Vamp, l'unica via d'uscita era uccidere
O'Brien. Vamp finse di partecipare per
ucciderlo durante l'esercitazione. Non
poteva fingere un incidente, così pensò a
una rivolta. Dead Cell sarebbe stata sciolta
e forse lui avrebbe perso la vita, ma era
sempre meglio che vendere il proprio
orgoglio.
Dolph esplose:
""Balle! Se O'Brien voleva il controllo,
avresti dovuto consegnargli Dead Cell!
Non dovevi sprecare la tua vita per quello!
Perché non l'hai fatto?""
Vamp scostò lo sguardo. Mentre lo
guardava, Dolph sembrò notare qualcosa.
""... C'è qualcos'altro, non è così?""
Paralizzato dallo sguardo fisso di Dolph,
Vamp prese a parlare, come chi perde una
battaglia:
""O'Brien trascinò il suo nemico politico in
questa esercitazione. O'Brien mi ordinò di
uccidere questo suo nemico, cioè te...
Scott, come prova di obbedienza ai suoi
comandi... Ma quella era l'ultima cosa che
volevo fare...""
Dolph farfugliò sbalordito:
""Ma è impossibile...""
Vamp mi guardò con occhi supplichevoli.
""Adesso uccidimi. Non c'è rimasto niente
in questo mondo che io voglia vedere.""
""Niente affatto. Non prendo ordini da te,""
dissi. Vamp chinò il capo. Io proseguii:
""... Anzi, penso che dovresti vivere. Cerca
di non rattristare le persone che ti vogliono
bene più di quanto tu non abbia già fatto.""
""Grazie..."" disse Dolph.#C0
","Vamp gemette.
""Non potevo dire niente...""
""È stato Jackson?"" chiese qualcuno. Era
Dolph. Doveva averci sentito combattere e
ci aveva trovati.
Vamp non diede risposta. Dolph
s'inginocchiò accanto a Vamp e ripeté la
domanda.
""C'è una sola persona che stai cercando di
proteggere. Si tratta di Jackson?""
Vamp si voltò da un'altra parte. Dolph prese
il viso di Vamp tra le mani e lo fece voltare
di nuovo.
""Glielo chiederò di persona, comunque. È
stato Jackson?!""
Vamp allontanò le mani di Dolph.
""Sì..."" Vamp disse queste parole mentre
sputava sangue.
""Il Capitano si è sempre rimproverato per
questo. Voleva a tutti i costi trovare il modo
di risollevare Dead Cell e il suo onore. In
prigione non faceva che parlare di questo,
giorno dopo giorno, come impazzito. Un
giorno volle vedermi. A proposito del
'linciaggio'.""
Vamp ebbe uno spasmo al volto. Non penso
che dipendesse dal dolore.
""Non era più l'eccezionale Capitano che
avevo conosciuto. Era sulla soglia della
pazzia, o forse l'aveva già varcata... Non
potevo fare altro che obbedire.""
""... Allora Jackson ti ha ordinato di fare
questo?"" chiesi.
""... No. Sono stato solo io. Dovevo farla
finita. Perché lui aveva scoperto...""
""Lui?""
""O'Brien.""
Vamp continuò a parlare.
In qualche modo, O'Brien aveva scoperto
che a muovere i fili del ""linciaggio"" era
Jackson. O'Brien aveva dunque richiesto
che Vamp passasse al suo comando come
membro di Dead Cell. Vamp intuì il piano di
O'Brien: rafforzare la sua autorità
dimostrando ai militari che era in grado di
controllare il problema di Dead Cell ed
espandere i suoi poteri occupandosi della
squadra di operazioni al di fuori della
legalità. Vamp rifiutò: non dovevano usare
Dead Cell come uno strumento del Governo.
Allora O'Brien minacciò di dire che Jackson
stava ordinando a Vamp di compiere gli
omicidi. Se lo avesse fatto, il nome di Dead

Dead Cell era un grupo de combate naval

entrenar a grupos antiterroristas y a asaltar
por sorpresa edificios gubernamentales para
determinar así su nivel de seguridad.
Aunque era bien conocida la ferocidad de
sus ataques, su reputación se debía a otro
factor. Se rumoreaba que sus
entrenamientos antiterroristas eran en
realidad tapaderas para su verdadera
misión: operar al límite de la ley para
debilitar las amenazas de los intereses de
los Estados Unidos. Bien fuera en los
Estados Unidos o en otro país, cuando un
movimiento antiamericano era exterminado,
un líder asesinado o había muertes dudosas,
inevitablemente asociaban a Dead Cell con
los hechos ocurridos. Nunca se habían
confirmado esos rumores. Sin embargo, el
nombre de Dead Cell se asociaba ya a las
palabras muerte, desastre y destrucción.
Hasta hace un año... 
Hace un año, el Comandante de Dead Cell,
el Coronel Jackson fue arrestado acusado
de sobornos y corrupción. A partir de

de corrupción y deshonra. E incluso se llegó
a cuestionar su efectividad en el campo de

permitido participar a su líder, Vamp.

Los ejercicios conjuntos estaban a punto de
concluir. Estaba patrullando la zona que me
habían asignado, la zona del Soporte F.
Inmediatamente después de recibir un
informe que decía que la mitad de los
terroristas habían sido reducidos, recibí una
transmisión de emergencia codificada a

""Aquí Pliskin. ¡¿Qué ha ocurrido?!""
respondí.

cortó.
Cambié de frecuencia inmediatamente.

""Aquí Dolph. ¿Eres Snake?""

Era el Comandante de los Marines, Scott
Dolph. Formaba parte del ejercicio que se
estaba llevando a cabo en el Big Shell.
Le expliqué la situación. Contestó entre un
gran barullo:

""Parece que aquí está ocurriendo lo mismo.""
""¿Cuál es la situación?""

""Ha habido una explosión en el núcleo del
Shell 2. El B1 está prácticamente inundado.""
""¿... Era esto lo que te preocupaba?""
Tres días antes había aceptado la invitación
de Dolph, quería que me incorporara al
ejercicio. Dolph estaba preocupado,
pensaba que iba a ocurrir algo, y quería
que, en caso de que ocurriera, me ocupara
de ello. Pero no me dijo por qué. Sólo me
dijo ""Confío en ti"". 
Dolph y Dead Cell tenían un punto de
conexión. La hija de Dolph, Helena, era la
mujer de Jackson. Cuando arrestaron a
Jackson, Dolph fue el único que defendió a
Dead Cell y a Jackson. Como resultado,
puso en peligro su propio puesto y su
reputación. A Dolph le preocupaba algo que
estaba sucediendo en el grupo Dead Cell.
Acepté su invitación sin dudarlo. Estaba en
deuda con Dolph.

Dolph creó una identidad falsa para mí. Y
aquí estaba, formando parte del ejercicio

pregunté.

""¿Qué está haciendo Vamp?""

""No tengo ni idea...""

denotaba preocupación.

0x7edf2,"En el Soporte B fui recibido por una gran
masacre. Los cuerpos sin vida de los

lados. Todo había sido destrozado y había
sangre por todos los lados. Escuché un
sollozo que provenía de uno de los hombres
que yacía sobre su propio charco de
sangre.
""¡Aguanta!""
Corrí hacia él y le sujeté en mis brazos.
Todavía respiraba, pero las heridas eran
muy profundas, tan profundas que habían
afectado a sus órganos internos. Estaba
claro que no iba a vivir. Su mirada estaba
medio perdida.
""Ha sido Vamp... Ha dicho que era un
""linchamiento""... se vengaba de todos
aquellos que habían traicionado a Jackson.
Lo ha llamado, el precio del soborno...""
""Será mejor que no hables,"" dije, intentando
tranquilizarle.
Pero él continuó hablando.
""Vamp va tras el Capitán O'Brien... Pero no
tiene sentido. El Capitán no está
implicado...
Él no es de ese tipo... no así.""
El Capitán de la Marina, O'Brien, había sido
condecorado en múltiples ocasiones, en la
guerra del Golfo Pérsico, en Europa, en
África... y era el Comandante Jefe de este
ejercicio. Los medios de comunicación
elogiaban al Capitán por ser un hombre
competente y un militar honrado, y además
muy querido por sus compañeros y
subalternos.
Me agarró el pecho. Para estar a punto de
morir, tenía mucha fuerza.
""El Capitán está... en el primer piso del
núcleo del Shell 2... Salva al Capitán, ¡por
favor...!""
Su cuerpo perdió la fuerza. Le cerré los
ojos. Era lo único que podía hacer ya por él.
Me puse en contacto con Dolph, y le dije lo
que había escuchado.
""Ya veo..."" murmuró Dolph. 
No parecía en absoluto sorprendido. Es
más, parecía que mis palabras no hacían
sino confirmar sus temores.
""¿Ya lo sabías?"" pregunté.
Se quedó callado y luego contestó dudando.
""Últimamente ha habido muchos casos de
muertes de empleados del gobierno y
funcionarios. Se decía que Vamp era el
responsable.""
""¿Y Jackson es realmente inocente?""
""No estoy seguro, pero puede que sí.
Estaba muy orgulloso de ser soldado, no
creo que fuera de esos tipos propensos a
la corrupción."" 
""¿Tú crees que O'Brien traicionó a
Jackson?""
""No, creo que no. Su reputación...""
""¿Cómo puedes estar tan seguro?"" 
""Fue O'Brien quien organizó este ejercicio.
Si él estuviera involucrado de alguna forma
en el caso de Jackson, no habría contado
con Vamp para el ejercicio.""
""Pero igual O'Brien no sabía nada sobre
el linchamiento, ¿no?""
""Sí que lo sabía.""
""¿Estás seguro?""
""Segurísimo. Fue precisamente O'Brien
quien me lo contó a mí.""
""¿Tú y O'Brien intercambiáis ese tipo de
información?""
Estaba sorprendido. O'Brien y Dolph... el
Capitán de la Marina y el líder de los
Marines. Así en principio, no suena como
una pareja muy feliz.
Dolph contestó porque adivinaba mi
asombro.
""O'Brien y yo no siempre nos hemos
llevado bien, debido a nuestros respectivos
cargos. Es más, yo creo que no le caigo
particularmente bien. Pero tampoco me odia
lo suficiente como para no aconsejarme,
especialmente cuando mi vida corre
peligro.""
""¿Qué quieres decir?""
""O'Brien vino a advertirme de que era el
próximo objetivo de Vamp."" 
Entonces comprendí por qué Dolph estaba
participando en este ejercicio.
""Así que intentaste limpiar el nombre de
Dead Cell poniéndote a tiro de Vamp...""
""Correcto. Si no me ocurre nada durante
este ejercicio, demostraré que los rumores
que corren son falsos.""
""... Confías entonces en Vamp.""
Dolph se despreciaba a sí mismo.
""Yo no diría tanto. Si confiara en él
completamente, no te hubiera llamado... Soy
un cobarde.""
Le dije que no era tan fácil confiar
plenamente en algo o alguien. Dolph no
respondió. Entonces le pregunté.
""Pero entonces Vamp no va a por ti sino a
por O'Brien.""
""Sí... o la información que me dio O'Brien
es falsa o Vamp miente.""
Parecía que Dolph también estaba
confundido.
""Lo único que es cierto es que Vamp está
intentado matar a O'Brien... Snake, tienes
que detener a Vamp.""

chupó el cuchillo con su afilada lengua y me
lo arrojó. Y luego desapareció en el interior

De alguna forma, O'Brien se había enterado
de que Jackson estaba detrás del
""linchamiento"". Por eso O'Brien había
pedido que Vamp fuera puesto bajo su
mando, como miembro de Dead Cell. Vamp
se dio cuenta de lo que O'Brien planeaba:
fortalecer su autoridad demostrando al
ejército que él podía controlar al tan
problemático Dead Cell, al mismo tiempo
que sus poderes se veían aumentados al
controlar al equipo de operaciones extra
legales. Vamp se negó. Dead Cell no sería
utilizado como un instrumento del gobierno.
Así que O'Brien le amenazó con hacer
público el hecho de que Jackson estaba
ordenando a Vamp que llevara a cabo esos
asesinatos. Y si lo hacía, el nombre de
Dead Cell se ensuciaría para siempre. Así
es como O'Brien trabajaba.
La única solución para Vamp era matar a
O'Brien. Vamp le siguió el rollo para poder
matarle en este ejercicio. No podía hacer
que era un accidente. Sería una revuelta.
Dead Cell sería disuelto y él probablemente
moriría. Pero era mejor que vender su
orgullo.
Dolph explotó.
""¡No digas bobadas! Si era lo que él
quería, haberle entregado a Dead Cell.
¡No tenías que arriesgar tu vida por eso!
¿Por qué lo hiciste?""
Vamp miró hacia otro lado. Al mirarle,
Dolph se dio cuenta de algo.
""... Hay algo más, ¿no?""
Paralizado por la mirada de Dolph, Vamp
habló derrotado.
""O'Brien hizo que su enemigo político
también participara en este ejercicio.
O'Brien me ordenó que matara a su
enemigo, a ti... Scott, era una prueba para
demostrar que estaba bajo su mando...
Pero eso era lo último que yo haría...""
Dolph murmuró asombradísimo,
""Eso es una locura...""
Vamp me miró suplicando.
""Ahora mátame. Ya no queda nada en este
mundo que yo quiera ver.""
""Ni lo sueñes. Yo no acato tus órdenes,"" le
dije.
Vamp dejó caer su cabeza. Yo continué.
""... Es más, creo que tienes que vivir. No
hagas que la gente que te quiere sufra
todavía más.""
""Gracias..."" dijo Dolph.#C0
","Vamp gruñó.
""No podía decir nada...""
""¿Fue Jackson? preguntó una voz. Era
Dolph. Probablemente había escuchado el
ruido de nuestra lucha y por eso consiguió
localizarnos.
Vamp no respondió. Dolph se arrodilló al
lado de Vamp y le repitió la misma
pregunta.
""Sólo hay una persona a la que estás
intentando proteger. ¿Es Jackson?""
Vamp se giró. Dolph cogió la cara de Vamp
con ambas manos y le dio la vuelta de
nuevo.
""Se lo voy a preguntar a él de todas las
formas. ¡¿Fue Jackson?!""
Vamp apartó las manos de Dolph. 
""Sí...""
Dijo Vamp al mismo tiempo que al toser,
sangre brotó de su boca.
""El Capitán se autoculpó todo el tiempo.
Quería buscar una forma de restaurar la
reputación y el honor de Dead Cell. Era de
lo único que hablaba en el cárcel, día tras
día, como si estuviera poseído. Un día me
llamó. Quería hablar de este
""linchamiento"".""
Un tic se asomó en la cara de Vamp. No
creo que fuera a causa del dolor.
""Ya no quedaba nada del brillante Capitán
que yo había conocido. Estaba al borde. O
quizás ya estaba totalmente perdido... No
me quedaba más remedio que obedecerle.""
""¿Así que Jackson te ordenó que hicieras
esto?"" pregunté.
""No. Fue idea mía. Tenía que acabar con
esto. Por que él lo había descubierto...""
""¿Él?""
""O'Brien.""
Vamp continuó.
De alguna forma, O'Brien se había enterado
de que Jackson estaba detrás del
""linchamiento"". Por eso O'Brien había
pedido que Vamp fuera puesto bajo su
mando, como miembro de Dead Cell. Vamp
se dio cuenta de lo que O'Brien planeaba:
fortalecer su autoridad demostrando al
ejército que él podía controlar al tan
problemático Dead Cell, al mismo tiempo
que sus poderes se veían aumentados al
controlar al equipo de operaciones extra
legales. Vamp se negó. Dead Cell no sería
utilizado como un instrumento del gobierno.
Así que O'Brien le amenazó con hacer
público el hecho de que Jackson estaba
ordenando a Vamp que llevara a cabo esos
asesinatos. Y si lo hacía, el nombre de
Dead Cell se ensuciaría para siempre. Así
es como O'Brien trabajaba.
La única solución para Vamp era matar a
O'Brien. Vamp le siguió el rollo para poder
matarle en este ejercicio. No podía hacer
que era un accidente. Sería una revuelta.
Dead Cell sería disuelto y él probablemente
moriría. Pero era mejor que vender su
orgullo.
Dolph explotó.
""¡No digas bobadas! Si era lo que él
quería, haberle entregado a Dead Cell.
¡No tenías que arriesgar tu vida por eso!
¿Por qué lo hiciste?""
Vamp miró hacia otro lado. Al mirarle,
Dolph se dio cuenta de algo.
""... Hay algo más, ¿no?""
Paralizado por la mirada de Dolph, Vamp

0x868ac,"My photo of Gurlugon sat on the table 
at the hideout. 
""No sign today?"" I asked Mei Ling.
""No. Looks like it hasn't shown up 
today, either.""
It had been a week. No new sightings 
of Gurlugon. No one knew where he'd 
show up next. 
Maybe he'd never show up ever again.
I believed Olga. It didn't seem like she 
was lying, and what's more, the 
existence of that ridiculous monster 
was proof in and of itself. There was no 
way something like that could live in 
our world, but it might be possible in 
another. Otacon brought up a theory 
about ""parallel universes.""
As usual, Otacon gave far more of an 
explanation than necessary. But in a 
nutshell, the idea was that rather than a 
single universe, there were countless 
universes existing in parallel. That 
meant that one universe might be 
exactly the same as mine, except the 
number of hairs on my head was off by 
one. In another universe, civilization 
might have sprung from paramecia. 
There could even be a universe full of 
monsters. Otacon thought these 
universes were supposed to be mutually 
exclusive, but for some reason had 
begun randomly intersecting. That was 
how the Olga we knew became switched
with an Olga from a parallel universe, 
and how that monster came to be in 
ours. And Otacon warned that the 
phenomenon seemed to be progressing 
as we spoke.
But if his theory was correct, we were in
for big trouble. For example, it was 
possible that in an hour, I might switch 
with another version of myself from a 
different universe. Otacon might have 
already been switched with a different 
Otacon. What would happen to us if we 
switched to a universe, say, where the 
Moon was about to collide with the Earth
or something? It was simply impossible 
to predict what might happen next.
Fortunately, the moon hadn't smashed 
into us yet - or at least not in our 
universe. Of course, that didn't 
guarantee we'd be safe tomorrow.
""How's the analysis of the VR system 
coming?""
Otacon shook his head.
""I'm not getting anything at all....""

Otacon looked sick when he heard Olga 
had said that the VR system was the 
root of the problem. He told me that the 
Koppelthorn Engine, the heart of the 
new VR system, was a quantum 
computational device designed by 
Dr. Koppelthorn, but the principles 
behind it remained unknown. He 
opened the housing, a literal black box,
and found nothing inside except some 
mysterious circuits, clattering gears, 
and what appeared to be some iron 
spheres. But somehow, it worked. 
That's probably why it was such a 
source of excitement for some people. 
Pseudo-science aficionados had 
examined the thing, but the only 
conclusions thus far had centered 
around the possibility that it made use 
of components from UFOs or artifacts 
from a lost civilization. Meaning nobody 
had figured out what made it tick. And 
what's more, nobody had ever seen this 
Dr. Koppelthorn himself or herself, 
either.
So what was the connection between 
this mysterious VR system and the 
collision of the parallel universes? Olga 
had said that the root of the problem 
was the VR system's ""peeking"" into 
other universes. But Mei Ling had her 
own theory. The Koppelthorn Engine-
based VR system wasn't simply 
constructing a virtual reality through its 
calculations, but managed to get around 
the wall separating the parallel 
universes, peering into parallel realities 
that satisfied certain requirements, and 
incorporating that information into the 
VR system's virtual reality construct. 
Perhaps that observation and 
interference was creating the 
disturbance in the parallel universes. 
But that wasn't all, said Mei Ling. 
Perhaps Olga was searching for the 
Gurlugon because it was the cause of 
the distortion among the parallel 
universes. The Gurlugon had become 
the fulcrum around which space had 
warped. And if that was true, there 
would be no way to stop the distortion 
without getting rid of the Gurlugon 
itself.
And for that reason, we continued 
searching for the Gurlugon. We'd lost 
all trace of the monster, and hadn't 
made any further progress into 
analyzing the VR system. But the 
disturbance of the parallel universes 
might well be continuing. It was 
possible that some of the universes 
might even be in peril. And it was 
equally possible that our universe 
could follow the same path moments 
later. We were completely frazzled.

Suddenly, Mei Ling spoke.
""If killing Gurlugon will make things 
right, there might be a way.""
""What do you mean?"" 
Otacon raised his face, and Mei Ling 
began her explanation.
""If it's true that the VR system can 
interfere with other parallel universes, 
why not try killing Gurlugon within the 
VR system? That could mean we're 
actually killing the original Gurlugon, 
and the Gurlugon in our universe could 
disappear....""
""Isn't that just a little too extreme?"" 
objected Otacon.
To which Mei Ling shot back:
""We can't just sit back and stare at the 
photo! We've got to do something!
You agree with me, right, Snake?!""
""I'm not sure...."" I answered. Her logic 
seemed extreme no matter how I 
looked at it. But at the same time, I had
the feeling that I'd end up doing it 
anyway. Doing something for the sake 
of doing it wasn't the answer, but I had 
to agree we still hadn't come up with a 
solution to the problem.
A few hours later, I squared off against 
Gurlugon inside the VR system.#C0
","My photo of Gurlugon sat on the table 
at the hideout. 
""No sign today?"" I asked Mei Ling.
""No. Looks like it hasn't shown up 
today, either.""
It had been a week. No new sightings 
of Gurlugon. No one knew where he'd 
show up next. 
Maybe he'd never show up ever again.
I believed Olga. It didn't seem like she 
was lying, and what's more, the 
existence of that ridiculous monster 
was proof in and of itself. There was no 
way something like that could live in 
our world, but it might be possible in 
another. Otacon brought up a theory 
about ""parallel universes.""
As usual, Otacon gave far more of an 
explanation than necessary. But in a 
nutshell, the idea was that rather than a 
single universe, there were countless 
universes existing in parallel. That 
meant that one universe might be 
exactly the same as mine, except the 
number of hairs on my head was off by 
one. In another universe, civilization 
might have sprung from paramecia. 
There could even be a universe full of 
monsters. Otacon thought these 
universes were supposed to be mutually 
exclusive, but for some reason had 
begun randomly intersecting. That was 
how the Olga we knew became switched
with an Olga from a parallel universe, 
and how that monster came to be in 
ours. And Otacon warned that the 
phenomenon seemed to be progressing 
as we spoke.
But if his theory was correct, we were in
for big trouble. For example, it was 
possible that in an hour, I might switch 
with another version of myself from a 
different universe. Otacon might have 
already been switched with a different 
Otacon. What would happen to us if we 
switched to a universe, say, where the 
Moon was about to collide with the Earth
or something? It was simply impossible 
to predict what might happen next.
Fortunately, the moon hadn't smashed 
into us yet - or at least not in our 
universe. Of course, that didn't 
guarantee we'd be safe tomorrow.
""How's the analysis of the VR system 
coming?""
Otacon shook his head.
""I'm not getting anything at all....""

Otacon looked sick when he heard Olga

I saw a wicked smile on her face.
""We've just lost the only way to restore 
the parallel universes to normal.""

from the seat. Mei Ling responded:
""There's no question that the Gurlugon 
was the singularity that represented the

perform a counter-unitary conversion via
the Koppelthorn Engine, thereby 
dispersing the wave function to its state

satisfaction.

singularity means the disappearance of 
the only method to restore space, too.""

someone's orders to complete a certain 
objective.""
""Someone? Who?"" I asked her back.

""I believe he's called Solidus in your 
universe.""
""Solidus?!"" we screamed without 
thinking. Mei Ling slowly pointed at a 
wall and said: 
""Oh, speak of the devil...""
Just then, the wall exploded. Debris 
poured from the gap. Dust enveloped 
the area. And Solidus Snake, clad in a 
powered suit, stood in the middle. 
Solidus said to Mei Ling, 
""Kept you waiting, huh?""
""Honey!""
Mei Ling threw herself into Solidus' 
arms.
I dove for Solidus. He fired a missile 
from his snake hand. A dazzling flash. 
An explosion. I was thrown against the 
wall. I lost consciousness momentarily.

connecting numerous servers. If one 
could be built spanning across 
countless parallel universes, it would 
be possible to obtain near-limitless 
computing power.
""But when the universe-spanning 
Koppelthorn Engine was applied to the 
VR system, it became a device for 
controlling possibility itself."" Solidus 
continued.
""Controlling?""
""That's correct. When a VR system 
using the Koppelthorn Engine is 
instructed to build a virtual reality 
having a given set of conditions, it 
selects a group of universes having the 
potential to satisfy those conditions from
among a still indefinite number of 
parallel universes that still have wave 
functions that have not converged. 
It then presents these as the VR 
construct you see before you. What you 
call VR training is nothing less than the 
external observation of and interference 
with that group of parallel universes!""
I recalled the bizarre sensation of 
possessing another person's body 
when I was engaged in VR training. 
I suppose that was the sensation of 
interfering with another universe. 
Solidus' voice echoed:
""When you go through VR training, 
your actions within virtual reality are 
reflected in a set of corresponding 
universes. The resulting interference 
simultaneously acts as observation with
regards to a group of still-indefinite 
parallel universes besides the one that 
is receiving the interference. That 
means that the possibilities of the 
universe converge on the conditions 
corresponding to the actions you took. 
For example, let's say you just killed an 
enemy soldier within the VR simulation. 
That means that the universe containing 
the killed soldier was observed and 
made definite. In other words, universes 
where that soldier had not been killed 
lose their indefinite potential and are 
erased from existence,"" Solidus 
continued.
""The only universe permitted to exist 
in the end is the one that doesn't 
contradict the actions you took in 
the VR simulation. Do you realize what 
this means? When your game is over 
in the VR system and you try again, 
the potential for existence for that very 
universe is denied and eliminated as 
never having existed. That means that 
every single time you replay the game, 
an uncounted number of universes are 
destroyed!""
I was in total shock.
""The disturbance of the parallel 
universes you've seen is a distortion 
generated by external interference. 
I suppose you could see it as the death 
cries of the universes that have been 
killed off. The singularities are a 
condensed form of that distortion.""
I had a flashback of Olga, the 
Gurlugon, and Mei Ling. If this 
disturbance had really been caused by 
external interference, that meant...
""That means my own universe is 
receiving interference from VR systems 
in other universes?""
""Of course. Haven't you ever felt like 
your body wasn't your own, like you 
took an unexpected action after the 
fact? Or you were able to do 
something you didn't think was 
possible? That's because of 
interference from other universes. 
Perhaps the reason you were able to 
topple Shadow Moses is because of a 
helping hand from someone in another 
universe."" Solidus' laugh echoed 
through the space.
""Through my research into parallel 
universes, I learned that I was killed 
many times in different worlds. 
I decided to protect my selves. I refuse 
to recognize any universe where I am 
killed! And that's why I decided to 
make things right with the VR system. 
I interfere with other parallel universes 
using the VR system and control them 
such that I won't die there. I don't care 
how much of a disturbance I create or 
how many contradictory universes are 
eliminated. The only thing that's 
important is my survival. Period.""#C0
","There was nothing there. There was no 
light, no sound, no feeling of 
temperature or even of height. Was 
this the singularity? I called Otacon. 
But it was Solidus who answered.
""You're in what's called - how can I put 
this so you can understand it? - a gap 
between parallel universes.""
""Solidus?! What are you trying to 
do?! Why are you trying to destroy 
the universe?!"" I screamed.
""Destroy? Don't be stupid. This is a 
correction. Back to how things should 
be...""
""What do you mean?!""
""I don't know who created the 
Koppelthorn Engine, or where or when, 
or even why. But my guess is that it 
was designed as part of a grid 
computing system spread between the 
parallel universes.""
Grid computing. I'd heard the term from
Otacon. It was a technique for creating 
a networked supercomputer with 
massive computational abilities by 
connecting numerous servers. If one 
could be built spanning across 
countless parallel universes, it would 
be possible to obtain near-limitless 
computing power.

emerged from the darkness. Then a 
second one, then more, right after the 
others. Otacon screamed:

his swords. I said:

me with a piercing, menacing stare.

I let out a laugh. Soon both of us were

""Réveille-toi, Snake ! On est en train de

Mei Ling tapa sur une chaise.

""Mais...""
Otacon se pencha vers moi. ""Un monstre
d'origine inconnue est apparu ! En tant que
scientifique, je dois agir !""

Philanthropy !? On ne sait même pas si on

Mei Ling d'un ton sec, le regard menaçant.
""Mais...""
""Qu'est-ce que tu proposes au lieu de le
capturer !?""
""Vas-tu laisser cette occasion te filer entre

""Mais, mais...""

Otacon avança une théorie sur les « univers
parallèles ».
Comme toujours, Otacon donna plus
d'explications que je n'en voulais. En un
mot, il n'y avait probablement pas un
univers unique, mais une multitude d'univers
existant en parallèle. Il pouvait donc exister
un univers exactement identique au mien, à
un cheveu près. Dans un autre univers, la
civilisation pouvait être née des paramécies.
Il pouvait même y avoir un univers rempli de
monstres. D'après Otacon, ces univers
étaient censés s'exclure mutuellement mais,
sans qu'on sache pourquoi, ils avaient
commencé à s'entrecroiser au hasard. C'est
ainsi que notre Olga avait été remplacée par
une Olga d'un univers parallèle et que ce
monstre s'était retrouvé dans le nôtre. Et il
semblait que le phénomène progressait.

Mais si sa théorie était correcte, nous
allions avoir de gros ennuis. Par exemple, il
se pouvait que je sois remplacé par une
autre version de moi-même venant d'un
autre univers. Otacon avait peut-être déjà
été remplacé par un autre Otacon. Et si
nous passions dans un univers où la lune
est sur le point d'entrer en collision avec la
terre ? Il était impossible de prévoir ce qui
allait arriver. Certes, la lune ne nous était
pas encore tombée sur la tête. Pas dans
notre univers, du moins. Mais il n'était pas
dit que ça n'arriverait pas.

""Où en est l'analyse du système de RV ?""
Otacon secoua la tête.
""Je n'arrive à rien du tout...""
Lorsqu'il apprit qu'Olga avait dit que le
système de RV était à l'origine du problème,
Otacon eut l'air écœuré. Il m'expliqua que le
moteur de Koppelthorn qui était au cœur du
nouveau système de RV était un dispositif
de calcul quantique conçu par le Dr.
Koppelthorn, mais que ses principes
demeuraient inconnus. Il ouvrit le boîtier
noir, mais ne trouva rien de plus que des
circuits mystérieux, des engrenages
bruyants et ce qui ressemblait à des
sphères en fer. Pourtant, ça marchait. C'est
sûrement pour cela que certaines personnes
s'y intéressaient tant. Des amateurs
pseudo-scientifiques l'avaient examiné mais
les seules conclusions qu'ils tiraient étaient
que le dispositif était constitué de
composants provenant d'OVNIS ou d'une
civilisation disparue. Bref, personne ne
savait comment ça marchait. Et personne
n'avait jamais vu le Dr. Koppelthorn en
personne.

Quel était donc le lien entre ce mystérieux
système de RV et la collision des univers
parallèles ? Olga avait dit que la cause du
problème était liée au fait que le système de
RV permettait de « jeter un œil » dans
d'autres univers. Mais Mei Ling avait sa
propre théorie. Selon elle, le système de RV
ne se contentait pas de construire une
réalité virtuelle par ses calculs. Il pouvait
également franchir le mur séparant les
univers parallèles, entrer dans des réalités
parallèles répondant à certains critères et
incorporer ces informations dans la réalité
virtuelle créée par le système de RV. C'était
peut-être cette observation et cette
interférence qui créaient les
bouleversements au sein des univers
parallèles. Mais ce n'était pas tout, ajouta
Mei Ling. Peut-être qu'Olga cherchait le
Gurlugon parce qu'il était la cause de la
distorsion dans les univers parallèles.
Il était peut-être devenu le pivot autour
duquel l'espace s'était déformé. Et si c'était
vrai, il fallait l'éliminer pour arrêter la
distorsion.
|
C'est pour cela que nous continuâmes à
chercher le Gurlugon. Nous avions perdu
toute trace du monstre et n'avions fait
aucun progrès dans l'analyse du système de
RV. Mais la perturbation des univers
parallèles se poursuivait peut-être. Il se
pouvait même que certains des univers
soient en péril. Et il se pouvait aussi que
notre univers suive la même voie quelques
instants plus tard. Nous étions totalement
éreintés.

Soudain, Mei Ling parla.
""Si tuer le Gurlugon peut régler le problème,
il y a peut-être un moyen.""
""Que veux-tu dire ?"" Otacon leva la tête et

","De retour dans les ruines de notre cachette,
nous expliquâmes la situation à Olga. Après
avoir écouté, elle dit qu'il restait encore une
solution. ""Il est vrai que la particularité du
Gurlugon peut avoir été éliminée mais ça ne
veut pas dire que toutes les particularités de
tous les univers parallèles l'aient été.""
Une lueur d'espoir traversa les yeux
d'Otacon.
""Tu veux dire qu'il y a d'autres
particularités ?""
""Sûrement. Mais sous quelle forme et à quel
endroit, j'ignore. Elles seront difficiles à
trouver.""
""On a des données sur le Gurlugon.
Si nous analysons son comportement
et étudions son environnement avec
la RV, peut-être que...""
Otacon et Olga continuèrent leur
conversation technique. Pour finir, ils
optèrent pour une méthode visant à trouver
les particularités d'autres univers parallèles
en réglant de façon continue et précise le
paramètre de fonction d'onde du système de
RV afin d'imiter le comportement unique
d'une particularité. Bref, il semblait que
j'allais devoir affronter une série de
constructions de RV. Les préparations furent
très rapides. Je retournai au siège du

répondit.

""Je ne sais pas qui a créé le moteur de
Koppelthorn, ni où ni quand, ni même
pourquoi, mais je crois qu'il fait partie
intégrante d'un système de calcul distribué
s'étendant entre les univers parallèles.""
Le calcul distribué. Otacon en avait parlé.
Cette technique permettait, par la connexion
de multiples serveurs, de créer un
super-ordinateur en réseau aux capacités de
calcul énormes. Si on pouvait en construire
un s'étendant sur d'innombrables univers, on
pourrait obtenir une puissance de calcul
presque illimitée.
""Mais, une fois appliqué au système de RV,
ce moteur de Koppelthorn s'est transformé
en dispositif capable de contrôler la

""Contrôler ?""
""Exact. Quand on ordonne à un système de
RV doté du moteur de Koppelthorn de
construire une réalité virtuelle répondant à
certains critères, il sélectionne un groupe
d'univers pouvant répondre à ces critères
parmi un ensemble d'univers parallèles
encore indéfinis et ayant encore des
fonctions d'onde n'ayant pas convergé, puis
il les présente sous la forme de la
construction RV que tu vois devant toi. La
formation en RV n'est que l'observation
externe de ce groupe d'univers parallèles et
l'interférence avec lui !""
Je me souvins d'avoir éprouvé la sensation
bizarre d'avoir le corps de quelqu'un d'autre
lors de ma formation en RV. Elle était
sûrement due à l'interférence avec un autre
univers. La voix de Solidus résonna :
""Pendant la formation en RV, les actions
effectuées dans la réalité virtuelle se
reflètent dans un ensemble d'univers
correspondants. L'interférence résultante
agit simultanément comme observation d'un
groupe d'univers parallèles encore indéfinis
en plus de celui qui reçoit l'interférence.
Cela veut dire que les possibilités de
l'univers convergent selon les conditions qui
correspondent à tes actions. Par exemple,
supposons que tu viennes de tuer un soldat
ennemi dans la simulation de RV. Cela
signifie que l'univers contenant le soldat tué
a été observé et défini. En d'autres termes,
les univers ayant d'autres possibilités, bref
les univers parallèles où ce soldat n'a pas
été tué, perdent leur potentiel indéfini et
sont effacés.""
Solidus continua.
""En fait, les seuls univers autorisés à exister
sont ceux qui ne contredisent pas les
actions effectuées dans la simulation de RV.
Tu comprends ? Lorsque ta partie se
termine dans le système de RV et que tu
recommences, la possibilité d'existence de
cet univers est refusée et éliminée comme
si elle n'avait jamais existé. Cela veut dire
qu'à chaque fois que tu recommences une
partie, d'innombrables univers sont
détruits !""
J'étais sidéré.
""La perturbation des univers parallèles à
laquelle tu as assisté est une distorsion due
à une interférence externe. On pourrait la
comparer aux cris de mort des univers ayant
été tués. Les particularités sont une forme
condensée de cette distorsion.""
Je revis Olga, le Gurlugon et Mei Ling. Si
cette perturbation avait vraiment été causée
par une interférence externe, cela
signifiait...
""Cela signifie que mon propre univers reçoit
des interférences de systèmes de RV
d'autres univers ? ""
""Evidemment. Tu n'as jamais ressenti que
ton corps ne t'appartenait pas, que tu avais
agi d'une façon surprenante ? Ou que tu
étais capable de faire quelque chose que tu
croyais impossible ? C'est à cause des
interférences d'autres univers. C'est peut-
être parce que quelqu'un d'un autre univers
t'a aidé que tu es sorti victorieux de Shadow
Moses."" Le rire de Solidus retentit dans
l'espace.
""Au cours de mes recherches sur les
univers parallèles, j'ai appris que j'avais été
tué plusieurs fois dans des mondes
différents. J'ai décidé de protéger mes
différents « moi ». Je refuse de reconnaître
les univers où j'ai été tué ! C'est pourquoi

","En début d'après-midi, Rose et moi
marchions dans le parc. La lumière du soleil
filtrait à travers la cime des arbres. Nous
nous dirigeâmes vers un étang et nous
assîmes sur un banc. Alors que j'enlaçais
Rose, quelqu'un bondit de l'étang en
poussant un cri bizarre. C'était Vamp ! Il
sortit un couteau et le lança droit sur nous.
Tout en protégeant Rose, je sortis mon
pistolet et détruisis le couteau. Je continuai
à tirer. Une balle l'atteignit entre les yeux et
il tomba. Mais il se releva en gémissant.
J'entendis la voix tremblante de Rose.
""Ce n'est pas vrai... Comment...?""
Tout en léchant une goutte de sang de sa
longue langue, Vamp dit :
""Je suis déjà mort une fois. Alors ça suffit.""
Rose hocha la tête.
""Bon, je suppose qu'il n'y a rien à y faire.""
En poussant un autre cri, Vamp se précipita
vers l'étang. Il atterrit directement sur sa
surface et le traversa en criant :
""Votre mission consiste à tuer tous les
ennemis et à atteindre le but.
MAINTENANT !""#C0

Le Ta-ti-tu-te-to continua.
""Une vieille brosse à dents pourrait faire
l'affaire.""
Le I-ro-ha-ni-ho-he-to parla plus fort.
""N'oubliez pas de nettoyer l'extérieur des

d'urine, ça sentira mauvais.""
Je criai une question.

""Kurz gesagt, sie erlaubt die Konstruktion
von Umgebungen in der virtuellen Realität
mit einem noch nicht dagewesenen
Informationsumfang. Die Info wird in ein
Signal verwandelt, das über die Kopfgarnitur
in dein Gehirn übertragen wird, wobei Info
für jeden deiner Sinne direkt synthetisiert
und gleichzeitig die Rückkopplung von
deinem Körper unterbrochen wird. Somit
kann eine Umgebung in der VR empfunden
werden, die sich absolut nicht von der
realen Welt unterscheiden lässt, bis hin zum
Sehen, Hören, Schmecken und Tasten.""
Er macht eine Atempause. Diese
Gelegenheit darf ich nicht verstreichen
lassen.
""Aha, das ist mir jetzt klar..."" sagte ich und
wollte vom Sitz aufstehen. Aber Otacon ließ
nicht locker.
""Warte mal. Versuchen wir es doch
nochmal. Im nächsten Szenario geht es um
die Ausschaltung der Feinde, um einen
Fluchtweg für die Geiseln in Big Shell zu
sichern.""
Wahrscheinlich konnte es Otacon nicht
abwarten, sein neues Spielzeug
auszuprobieren. Widerwillig setzte ich mich
wieder. Otacon fuhr mit der Einweisung fort.
""Deine Mission besteht darin, alle Feinde
innerhalb einer bestimmten Zeit
auszuschalten. Fertig? Es geht los!""
Ich setzte die Kopfgarnitur wieder auf und
schloss die Augen. Ein Lichtstrahl blendete
meine Augen. Im nächsten Moment fand ich
mich von einer Welt umgeben, von der ich
kaum glauben konnte, dass sie nur ein

anderen könnte sich die Zivilisation aus

sich eigentlich ausschließen, hätten aber
begonnen, sich zufällig zu überschneiden.
Deshalb wurde unsere Olga mit einer Olga
aus einem Paralleluniversum ausgetauscht
und deshalb war das Monster in unser

Otacon war verunsichert, als ich ihm Olgas
Ansicht erzählte, das VR-System wäre die
Ursache des Problems. Er sagte, die
Koppelthorn-Maschine als Kern des neuen
VR-Systems wäre ein von Dr. Koppelthorn
entworfenes Quantenberechnungsgerät mit
bislang nicht bekannten Grundprinzipien. Er
öffnete das Gehäuse, einen buchstäblich
schwarzen Kasten, und fand im Innern
nichts als ein paar geheimnisvolle
Schaltkreise, klappernde Vorrichtungen und
ein paar Eisenkugeln. Aber irgendwie
funktionierte sie. Deshalb waren manche
Leute so begeistert von ihr.

verlorenen Zivilisation enthalten könnte.
Niemand hat herausgefunden, wie sie
wirklich funktioniert. Und außerdem hat
bisher niemand Dr. Koppelthorn von
Angesicht gesehen.

Worin besteht der Zusammenhang zwischen
diesem geheimnisvollen VR-System und der
Kollision paralleler Universen? Olga hatte
gesagt, die Wurzel des Problems wäre, dass
das VR-System in andere Universen
""späht"". Aber Mei Ling hatte eine eigene
Theorie. Das auf der Koppelthorn-Maschine
beruhende VR-System konstruierte mit
seinen Berechnungen nicht nur eine virtuelle
Realität, sondern es überwand auch die
Trennwand zwischen parallelen Universen,
konnte in parallele Realitäten spähen, die
bestimmten Erfordernissen entsprachen und
diese Informationen dann in das
Virtuelle-Realität-Konstrukt des VR-Systems
einbeziehen. Vielleicht erzeugte diese
Beobachtung und Interferenz die Störung in
den parallelen Universen. Das wäre aber
nicht alles, sagte Mei Ling. Vielleicht suchte
Olga nach dem Gurlugon, weil er die
Ursache für die Verzerrung zwischen den
parallelen Universen war. Der Gurlugon war
zu dem Drehpunkt geworden, um den sich
der Weltraum verwarf. Und wenn das wahr
wäre, könnte die Störung nur aufgehalten
werden, wenn der Gurlugon ausgeschaltet
würde.
Und aus diesem Grund suchten wir weiter
nach dem Gurlugon. Wir hatten jede Spur
des Monsters verloren und bei der Analyse
des VR-Systems keine weiteren Fortschritte
erreicht. Aber die Störung der parallelen
Universen konnte sich wohl fortsetzen. Es
war möglich, dass manche Universen
sogar in höchster Gefahr waren. Und
genauso war es möglich, dass unser
Universum Augenblicke später dasselbe
Schicksal erlitt. Wir waren völlig
zermürbt.

Möglichkeit, den Weltraum so
wiederherzustellen, wie wir ihn kennen,

Singularität einzufangen und mithilfe der

Umwandlung vorzunehmen, durch die die
Wellenfunktion in ihren Zustand vor der
Konvergenz aufgelöst würde...""

bedeutet aber auch, dass die einzige
Methode verschwunden ist, mit der der
Weltraum wiederhergestellt werden könnte.""

aus dem Loch geschleudert. Staub hüllte die
Umgebung ein. Und dann stand Solidus

Geschoss aus seiner Schlangenhand ab. Ein
blendender Blitz. Eine Explosion. Ich wurde
gegen die Wand geschleudert und verlor
augenblicklich das Bewusstsein. Als ich
wieder auf den Beinen war, sah ich, wie
Solidus Mei Ling in den Armen hielt und
durch das Loch flüchtete, das er soeben in
die Wand gesprengt hatte.#C0
","Gurlugon war besiegt und wir schalteten das
VR-System aus. Aber ich war irgendwie
immer noch nicht überzeugt. Ich nahm die
Kopfgarnitur ab und sagte zu Otacon:
""Na ja. Glaubst du, dass wir es wirklich
geschafft haben?""
Otacon zuckte mit den Schultern. Er schien
genauso zu denken wie ich.
Da schaltete sich Mei Ling ein:
""Natürlich ist die Mission gelungen.""
Dabei lächelte sie tückisch.
""Wir haben soeben die einzige Möglichkeit
verloren, die Normalität der parallelen
Universen wiederherzustellen.""
""Was hast du da gesagt!?"" fragte ich und
erhob mich vom Sitz. Mei Ling antwortete:
""Der Gurlugon war fraglos die Singularität,
die die Verwerfung in den parallelen
Universen repräsentierte. Aber die einzige
Möglichkeit, den Weltraum so
wiederherzustellen, wie wir ihn kennen,
besteht nicht darin, die Singularität zu
zerstören. Die Lösung besteht darin, die
Singularität einzufangen und mithilfe der
Koppelthorn-Maschine eine gegenunitäre
Umwandlung vorzunehmen, durch die die
Wellenfunktion in ihren Zustand vor der
Konvergenz aufgelöst würde...""
Mei Ling sprach weiter voll Selbstvertrauen.
""Das Verschwinden der Singularität
bedeutet aber auch, dass die einzige
Methode verschwunden ist, mit der der
Weltraum wiederhergestellt werden könnte.""
""Wer bist du!?""
Mei Ling höhnte bei Otacons Ausruf.
""Um es mit Olgas Worten zu sagen: Ich bin
nicht die Mei Ling, die ihr kennt. Aber tragt
es mir nicht nach, okay? Ich habe nur
jemandes Befehle befolgt, um ein
bestimmtes Ziel zu erreichen.""
""Wer ist dieser Jemand?"" fragte ich
zurück.
""Mein Ehemann"", antwortete Mei Ling mit
sanfter Stimme.
""Ich glaube, er heißt in unserem Universum
Solidus.""
""Solidus!?"" riefen wir ohne nachzudenken.
Mei Ling zeigte langsam auf eine Wand und
sagte:
""Ah, wenn man vom Teufel spricht...""
Da explodierte die Wand. Trümmer wurden
aus dem Loch geschleudert. Staub hüllte die
Umgebung ein. Und dann stand Solidus
Snake, der einen Spezialanzug trug, mitten
im Raum. Solidus sagte zu Mei Ling:
""Ich habe dich warten lassen, was?""
""Schatz!""
Mei Ling warf sich in Solidus Arme.
Ich sprang auf Solidus zu. Er feuerte ein
Geschoss aus seiner Schlangenhand ab. Ein

Rasterberechnung. Ich hatte den Begriff

Technik zur Schaffung eines

überbrückende Koppelthorn-Maschine

Koppelthorn-Maschine den Befehl zum
Aufbau einer virtuellen Realität mit
Vorgabebedingungen erhält, wählt es unter
parallelen Universen, die noch unbestimmt
sind und noch nicht konvergierte
Wellenfunktionen haben, eine Gruppe von
Universen mit dem Potenzial aus, diese
Bedingungen zu erfüllen. Das System
präsentiert diese als den VR-Konstrukt, den
du vor dir siehst. Was du VR-Training
nennst, ist die externe Beobachtung dieser
Gruppe paralleler Universen und die
Interferenz mit ihr!""

Interferierens mit einem anderen Universum.

""Während des VR-Trainings werden deine
Aktionen in der virtuellen Realität in einer
Reihe entsprechender Universen

Interferenz wirkt gleichzeitig als
Beobachtung einer Gruppe noch
unbestimmter Paralleluniversen neben dem
Universum, das die Interferenz empfängt.
Die Möglichkeiten des Universums
konvergieren somit zu den gleichen
Bedingungen, die den von dir ausgeführten
Aktionen entsprechen. Wenn du soeben
einen feindlichen Soldaten in der
VR-Simulation getötet hättest, würde das
Universum, das den getöteten Soldaten
enthält, beobachtet und bestimmt. Somit
verlieren Universen, die andere
Möglichkeiten als diese haben, also
Paralleluniversen, in denen dieser Soldat
nicht getötet wurde, ihr unbestimmtes
Potenzial und werden ausgelöscht.""
Solidus sprach weiter.
""Das einzige Universum, das am Ende noch
existieren darf, ist dasjenige, welches nicht
den Aktionen widerspricht, die du in der
VR-Simulation ausgeführt hast. Ist dir klar,
was das bedeutet? Wenn dein Spiel im
VR-System vorüber ist und du es noch
einmal versuchst, wird das Existenzpotenzial
ebendieses Universums verneint und
eliminiert, als hätte es nie existiert. Dies
heißt, dass jedesmal wenn du das Spiel
erneut spielst, eine ungezählte Anzahl von
Universen zerstört wird!""

Form dieser Verzerrung.""
Wie in einer Rückblende dachte ich an Olga,
den Gurlugon und Mei Ling. Wenn diese
Störung wirklich durch externe Interferenz
verursacht worden war, dann...
""Bedeutet das, dass mein eigenes
Universum Interferenzen von VR-Systemen
in anderen Universen empfängt?""
""Natürlich. Hattest du noch nie das
Gefühl, dein Körper wäre gar nicht
dein eigener, wenn du zum Beispiel eine
unerwartete Handlung ausführtest? Oder
wenn du etwas schafftest, das du nicht
für möglich gehalten hattest? Das
liegt an der Interferenz von anderen

Moses gepackt hast, war vielleicht eine
helfende Hand aus irgendeinem anderen

stand, wollte ich eigentlich nicht kämpfen.
Aber ich kämpfte und tötete ihn. Ich schien
keine Kontrolle über den Körper zu haben...
Solidus sagte, die Koppelthorn-Maschine
und das VR-System interferierten mit den
Paralleluniversen. Aber wenn er log? Oder
wenn es ein Gerät gab, mit dem sich ein
paralleles Universum von außen beobachten
und interferieren ließ...?  ""Du denkst zu

übrigens ...""
Er lehnte sich zu mir vor.
""Hast du gesagt, du hättest eine meiner

","Als ich zu mir kam, saß ich auf einem Stuhl
im Refugium. Ich sah mich im Raum um. Es
war dasselbe Refugium wie immer. Keine
Spur von dem Schaden, den Solidus
angerichtet hatte. War ich an einen Punkt
zurückgekehrt, bevor sich der ganze
Zwischenfall ereignet hatte? Mein Blick
kreuzte sich mit dem Otacons, der mir
gegenübersaß.
""Sind wir zurückgekommen?"" fragte
Otacon.
Seiner Stimme nach zu urteilen, schien er
eine ähnliche Erfahrung gemacht zu haben
wie ich. Aber es muss eine unzählige Anzahl
von Universen geben, in denen fast
dasselbe geschehen ist. Ich weiß nicht, ob
dieser Otacon mit mir in demselben
Universum gewesen ist, und es gab auch
keine Möglichkeit, das zu prüfen. Aber das
ist mir eigentlich egal. Die Person, die da
vor mir sitzt, ist Otacon.

0xa5f01,"La mia foto di Gurlugon stava sul tavolo del

Era passata una settimana senza nuovi
avvistamenti di Gurlugon. Nessuno sapeva

|
Credetti a Olga. Non sembrava che stesse
mentendo, inoltre l'esistenza di quel ridicolo
mostro ne era la prova lampante. Era
impossibile che qualcosa del genere potesse
vivere nel nostro mondo, ma forse era
possibile in un altro universo. Otacon tirò
fuori una teoria sugli ""universi paralleli"".
|
Come al solito, Otacon non si limitò a una
semplice spiegazione. In poche parole,
comunque, l'idea è che invece di un solo
universo, vi siano innumerevoli universi
paralleli, il che significa che un universo
potrebbe essere esattamente come il mio,
ad eccezione del numero dei capelli del mio
capo, minore di uno. In un altro universo, la
civiltà potrebbe essere derivata dai
parameci. Potrebbe anche esserci un
universo pieno di mostri. Otacon pensa che
questi universi dovrebbero escludersi a
vicenda, ma per qualche motivo avevano
iniziato a intersecarsi a caso. Per questo
l'Olga che conoscevamo era stata scambiata
con un'Olga di un universo parallelo e quel
mostro si era ritrovato nel nostro mondo.
Otacon avvertì che il fenomeno sembrava
progredire durante la nostra conversazione.
|
Ma se questa teoria è corretta, allora siamo
proprio nei guai. Ad esempio, tra un'ora
potrei passare a un'altra versione di me
stesso da un universo differente. Otacon
potrebbe già essere passato a un Otacon
diverso. Cosa ci succederebbe se
passassimo a un universo, ad esempio,
dove la Luna sta per entrare in collisione
con la Terra o robe simili? Era
semplicemente impossibile predire cosa
sarebbe potuto accadere dopo.
Per fortuna, la Luna non si è ancora
schiantata sulla Terra o, almeno, non nel
nostro universo. Naturalmente, questo non
ci garantisce che saremo al sicuro domani...
|
""Come sta andando l'analisi del sistema di
RV?""
Otacon scosse il capo.
""Non mi dà proprio niente...""
Otacon sembrò stare male quando sentì
Olga dire che il sistema di RV era alla base
del problema. Lui mi disse che il Motore
Koppelthorn, il nucleo del nuovo sistema di
RV, è un dispositivo di computo quantistico
progettato dal dottor Koppelthorn, ma i
principi su cui si basa sono ignoti. Aprì
l'alloggiamento, una semplice scatola nera,
e non vi trovò niente all'interno, tranne
circuiti misteriosi, meccanismi cigolanti e
sfere di ferro. In qualche modo, però,
funzionava. Forse è per questo che ha
destato stupore in alcune persone. Gli
appasionati di pseudoscienza lo hanno
esaminato, ma finora le uniche conclusioni
si sono concentrate sulla possibilità che
faccia uso di componenti provenienti dagli
UFO o di manufatti di una civiltà scomparsa.
Insomma, nessuno è riuscito a capire cosa
lo faccia funzionare; per di più, nessuno ha
mai visto il dottore o la dottoressa
Koppelthorn.
|
Allora qual è il collegamento tra questo
misterioso sistema di RV e la collisione degli
universi paralleli? Olga aveva detto che alla
base del problema c'era il sistema di RV che
""sconfinava"" negli altri universi. Secondo
Mei Ling, invece, il sistema di RV basato sul
Motore Koppelthorn non costruiva
semplicemente una realtà virtuale tramite i
calcoli, ma riusciva a superare il muro di
separazione tra gli universi paralleli,
sconfinando nelle realtà parallele che
soddisfano certi requisiti e incorporando le
informazioni nel costrutto di realtà virtuale
del sistema di RV. Forse quell'intrusione e
l'interferenza stavano generando disturbi
negli universi paralleli. Mei Ling disse che
c'era dell'altro: forse Olga stava cercando
Gurlugon perché era la causa della
distorsione tra gli universi paralleli. Gurlugon
era diventato il fulcro attorno al quale si era
alterato lo spazio. Se le cose stavano così,
non ci sarebbe stato alcun modo per
fermare la distorsione senza sbarazzarsi di
Gurlugon.
|
Per questo motivo, continuammo a cercare
Gurlugon. Avevamo perso ogni traccia del
mostro e non avevamo fatto altri progressi
nell'analisi del sistema di RV, però era
possibile che il disturbo degli universi
paralleli continuasse. C'era anche la
possibilità che alcuni universi fossero in
pericolo ed era altrettanto possibile che il
nostro universo potesse subire la stessa
sorte di lì a poco. Eravamo completamente
esausti.
|
D'un tratto, Mei Ling disse:
""Se l'uccisione di Gurlugon rimetterà le
cose a posto, ci potrebbe essere una
soluzione.""
""Che vuoi dire?"" Otacon sollevò il volto e
Mei Ling iniziò a dare la sua spiegazione.
""Se è vero che il sistema di RV può
interferire con altri universi paralleli, perché
non proviamo a uccidere Gurlugon
dall'interno del sistema di RV?
Effettivamente, uccideremmo il Gurlugon
originale e il Gurlugon che si trova nel
nostro universo potrebbe sparire...""
""Non sarà una soluzione un po' troppo
estrema?"" obiettò Otacon.
Mei Ling ribatté:
""Non possiamo continuare a fissare la foto
senza agire! Dobbiamo fare qualcosa! Tu
sei d'accordo con me, vero, Snake?!""
""Non ne sono sicuro..."" risposi. La sua
logica sembrava estrema, comunque la
guardassi. Ma allo stesso tempo, avevo il
presentimento che avrei finito per farlo
comunque. Fare qualcosa per il piacere di
farlo non era la soluzione giusta, ma dovevo
ammettere che non avevamo ancora trovato
una soluzione al problema.
Poche ore più tardi, affrontai Gurlugon
nell'interno del sistema di RV.#C0
","La mia foto di Gurlugon stava sul tavolo del
covo.  ""Niente avvistamenti oggi?"" chiesi a
Mei Ling.
""No. A quanto pare non si è fatto vedere
neanche oggi.""
Era passata una settimana senza nuovi
avvistamenti di Gurlugon. Nessuno sapeva
dove si sarebbe fatto rivedere.
Forse non si sarebbe più fatto rivedere.
|
Credetti a Olga. Non sembrava che stesse
mentendo, inoltre l'esistenza di quel ridicolo
mostro ne era la prova lampante. Era
impossibile che qualcosa del genere potesse
vivere nel nostro mondo, ma forse era
possibile in un altro universo. Otacon tirò
fuori una teoria sugli ""universi paralleli"".
|
Come al solito, Otacon non si limitò a una
semplice spiegazione. In poche parole,
comunque, l'idea è che invece di un solo
universo, vi siano innumerevoli universi
paralleli, il che significa che un universo
potrebbe essere esattamente come il mio,
ad eccezione del numero dei capelli del mio
capo, minore di uno. In un altro universo, la
civiltà potrebbe essere derivata dai
parameci. Potrebbe anche esserci un
universo pieno di mostri. Otacon pensa che
questi universi dovrebbero escludersi a
vicenda, ma per qualche motivo avevano
iniziato a intersecarsi a caso. Per questo
l'Olga che conoscevamo era stata scambiata
con un'Olga di un universo parallelo e quel
mostro si era ritrovato nel nostro mondo.
Otacon avvertì che il fenomeno sembrava
progredire durante la nostra conversazione.
|
Ma se questa teoria è corretta, allora siamo
proprio nei guai. Ad esempio, tra un'ora
potrei passare a un'altra versione di me
stesso da un universo differente. Otacon
potrebbe già essere passato a un Otacon
diverso. Cosa ci succederebbe se
passassimo a un universo, ad esempio,
dove la Luna sta per entrare in collisione
con la Terra o robe simili? Era
semplicemente impossibile predire cosa
sarebbe potuto accadere dopo.
Per fortuna, la Luna non si è ancora
schiantata sulla Terra o, almeno, non nel
nostro universo. Naturalmente, questo non
ci garantisce che saremo al sicuro domani...
|
""Come sta andando l'analisi del sistema di
RV?""
Otacon scosse il capo.
""Non mi dà proprio niente...""
Otacon sembrò stare male quando sentì
Olga dire che il sistema di RV era alla base
del problema. Lui mi disse che il Motore
Koppelthorn, il nucleo del nuovo sistema di
RV, è un dispositivo di computo quantistico
progettato dal dottor Koppelthorn, ma i
principi su cui si basa sono ignoti. Aprì
l'alloggiamento, una semplice scatola nera,
e non vi trovò niente all'interno, tranne
circuiti misteriosi, meccanismi cigolanti e
sfere di ferro. In qualche modo, però,
funzionava. Forse è per questo che ha
destato stupore in alcune persone. Gli
appasionati di pseudoscienza lo hanno
esaminato, ma finora le uniche conclusioni
si sono concentrate sulla possibilità che
faccia uso di componenti provenienti dagli
UFO o di manufatti di una civiltà scomparsa.
Insomma, nessuno è riuscito a capire cosa
lo faccia funzionare; per di più, nessuno ha
mai visto il dottore o la dottoressa
Koppelthorn.
|
Allora qual è il collegamento tra questo
misterioso sistema di RV e la collisione degli
universi paralleli? Olga aveva detto che alla
base del problema c'era il sistema di RV che
""sconfinava"" negli altri universi. Secondo
Mei Ling, invece, il sistema di RV basato sul
Motore Koppelthorn non costruiva
semplicemente una realtà virtuale tramite i
calcoli, ma riusciva a superare il muro di
separazione tra gli universi paralleli,
sconfinando nelle realtà parallele che
soddisfano certi requisiti e incorporando le
informazioni nel costrutto di realtà virtuale
del sistema di RV. Forse quell'intrusione e
l'interferenza stavano generando disturbi
negli universi paralleli. Mei Ling disse che
c'era dell'altro: forse Olga stava cercando
Gurlugon perché era la causa della
distorsione tra gli universi paralleli. Gurlugon
era diventato il fulcro attorno al quale si era
alterato lo spazio. Se le cose stavano così,
non ci sarebbe stato alcun modo per
fermare la distorsione senza sbarazzarsi di
Gurlugon.
|
Per questo motivo, continuammo a cercare
Gurlugon. Avevamo perso ogni traccia del
mostro e non avevamo fatto altri progressi
nell'analisi del sistema di RV, però era
possibile che il disturbo degli universi
paralleli continuasse. C'era anche la
possibilità che alcuni universi fossero in

nostro universo potesse subire la stessa
sorte di lì a poco. Eravamo completamente

Fu allora che Mei Ling disse:
""Ma certo che la missione è riuscita.""
Le vidi affiorare un sorriso maligno sul volto.
""Abbiamo appena perso l'unico modo di
riportare gli universi paralleli alla normalità.""
""Che hai detto?!"" chiesi alzandomi dalla
postazione. Mei Ling replicò:
""Senza dubbio Gurlugon era la rarità che
rappresentava l'alterazione negli universi
paralleli, ma l'unica soluzione per riportare
lo spazio alla normalità non è distruggere la
rarità. La soluzione è catturare la rarità,
eseguire una conversione antiunitaria
tramite il Motore Koppelthorn, disperdendo
la funzione d'onda al suo stato prima della
convergenza...""
Mei Ling proseguì, esprimendo piena
soddisfazione:
""Tuttavia, la scomparsa della rarità
comporta anche la scomparsa dell'unico
metodo per ripristinare lo spazio.""
""Ma insomma, chi sei?!""
Mei Ling sogghignò al grido di Otacon.
""Riprendendo le parole di Olga, io non sono
la Mei Ling che conoscete, ma amici come
prima, okay? Eseguivo solo gli ordini di
qualcuno per completare un determinato
obiettivo.""
""Qualcuno? Chi?"" replicai.
""Mio marito,"" rispose Mei Ling con
dolcezza.
""Credo che si chiami Solidus nel vostro
universo.""
""Solidus?!"" urlammo senza pensarci. Mei
Ling indicò lentamente verso un muro e
disse:  ""Oh, parli del diavolo...""
In quel momento il muro esplose riversando
polvere e detriti in tutta l'area. Nel bel
mezzo comparve Solidus Snake, in uniforme
motorizzata. Solidus disse a Mei Ling:
""Ti ho fatto aspettare, eh?""
""Tesoro!""
Mei Ling si gettò tra le braccia di Solidus.
Mi precipitai verso Solidus, ma lui lanciò un
missile dalla sua mano-serpente. Ci fu un
lampo abbagliante e un'esplosione.
Scagliato contro il muro, persi i sensi per un
po'. Quando riuscii a rimettermi in piedi, vidi

""Esatto. Quando un sistema di RV che usa

tue azioni nella realtà virtuale si riflettono in
una serie di universi corrispondenti.
L'interferenza che ne deriva agisce
contemporaneamente come osservazione
riguardo a un gruppo di universi paralleli
ancora indefiniti oltre a quello che sta
ricevendo l'interferenza. Ciò significa che le
possibilità dell'universo convergono sulle
stesse condizioni corrispondenti alle azioni
da te eseguite. Ad esempio, supponiamo
che hai appena ucciso un soldato nemico
nella simulazione in RV: l'universo
contenente il soldato ucciso è stato dunque
osservato e reso definito. In altre parole, gli
universi con possibilità diverse da quella,
insomma gli universi paralleli dove quel
soldato non è stato ucciso, perdono il
potenziale indefinito e sono eliminati
dall'esistenza.""
Solidus continuò:
""Alla fine, l'unico universo ad avere il
permesso di esistere è quello che non
contraddice le azioni che hai eseguito nella
simulazione in RV. Ti rendi conto di cosa
significa? Quando il gioco termina nel
sistema di RV e tu lo ritenti di nuovo, il
potenziale di esistenza per quello stesso
universo viene negato ed eliminato come se
non fosse mai esistito. Ciò significa che ogni
singola volta che ripeti il gioco, viene
distrutta un'innumerevole quantità di
universi!""
Ero completamente allibito.
""I disturbi degli universi paralleli che hai
visto sono distorsioni generate da
interferenze esterne. Suppongo che potresti
considerarli come le grida di morte degli
universi che hai fatto fuori. Le rarità sono
una forma condensata di quelle distorsioni.""
Mi tornarono in mente Olga, Gurlugon e Mei
Ling. Se questi disturbi erano davvero stati
causati da interferenze esterne, voleva dire
che...
""Vuol dire che il mio stesso universo sta
ricevendo interferenze dai sistemi di RV in
altri universi?""
""Proprio così. Non hai mai avuto
l'impressione che il corpo non fosse il tuo,
come se avessi compiuto un'azione
imprevista dopo il fatto? O quando sei stato
capace di fare qualcosa che non credevi
possibile? Ciò è dovuto a interferenze da
altri universi. Forse il motivo per cui ti è
andata bene a Shadow Moses è che
qualcuno ti ha dato una mano da un altro
universo."" La risata di Solidus risuonò nello
spazio.
""Nelle mie ricerche sugli universi paralleli,
ho appreso di essere stato ucciso tante
volte in mondi diversi. Ho deciso di
proteggermi. Mi rifiuto di riconoscere gli
universi in cui vengo ucciso! È per questo
che ho deciso di sistemare le cose con il
sistema di RV. Interferisco con altri universi
paralleli usando il sistema di RV e li
controllo in modo tale che non ci morirò. Me
ne infischio di quanti disturbi creo o di
quanti universi contraddittori vengono
eliminati. M'importa solo la mia
sopravvivenza. Punto e basta.""#C0
","Lì non c'era niente: né luci, né suoni, né
alcuna sensazione di temperatura o di
altezza. Era quella la rarità? Chiamai
Otacon, ma fu Solidus a rispondermi.
""Sei in quello che viene chiamato... come
posso fartelo capire? Uno spazio vuoto tra
universi paralleli.""
""Solidus?! Cosa stai cercando di fare?!
Perché stai tentando di distruggere
l'universo?!"" urlai.
""Distruggere? Ma non fare lo stupido. Si
tratta di una correzione. Rimetto le cose al
loro posto...""
""Cosa vorresti dire?!""
""Non so chi abbia creato il Motore
Koppelthorn, né dove, né quando,
tantomeno il perché, ma penso che dovesse
fare parte di un sistema di calcolo 'grid
computing' esteso tra universi paralleli.""
Grid computing. Ne avevo sentito parlare da
Otacon. Era una tecnica per creare un
supercomputer collegato in rete, con enormi
capacità di calcolo tramite il collegamento di
numerosi server. Se ne fosse stato costruito
uno esteso tra innumerevoli universi
paralleli, sarebbe stato possibile ottenere
una potenza di calcolo pressoché illimitata.
""Ma quando il Motore Koppelthorn esteso
agli universi è stato applicato al sistema di
RV, è diventato un dispositivo di controllo
della possibilità stessa,"" proseguì Solidus.
""Controllo?""
""Esatto. Quando un sistema di RV che usa
il Motore Koppelthorn riceve il comando di
costruire una realtà virtuale con una certa
serie di condizioni, seleziona un gruppo di
universi con il potenziale di soddisfare tali
condizioni tra una serie di universi paralleli
che sono ancora indefiniti e che hanno
ancora funzioni d'onda non convergenti,
dopo di che li presenta sotto forma del
costrutto di RV che ti appare alla vista. Ciò
che chiami addestramento in RV non è altro
che l'osservazione esterna e l'interferenza
con quel gruppo di universi paralleli!""
Mi rammentai la strana sensazione di
possedere il corpo di un'altra persona
quando ero occupato nell'addestramento in
RV. Era forse quella la sensazione
d'interferenza con un altro universo. La voce
di Solidus echeggiò:
""Quando esegui l'addestramento in RV, le
tue azioni nella realtà virtuale si riflettono in
una serie di universi corrispondenti.
L'interferenza che ne deriva agisce
contemporaneamente come osservazione

""Oh, eso sin duda. Antes de nada
deberíamos de patentarlo.""
Y prosiguieron con lo que a mí me parecía
una conversación totalmente ridícula. Era
imposible que lo estuvieran considerando,
pero por si acaso, tenía que preguntarlo.
""Eh, espero que no habléis en serio con eso
de atrapar a esa bestia...""
Otacon me miró muy sorprendido.
""¡Snake, despierta! ¡Estamos hablando de
un monstruo!""
Mei Ling dio una patada a una silla.
""¡Él tiene razón! ¡Se trata de un
monstruo!""
""Pero...""
Otacon se inclinó hacia mí.
""¡Ha aparecido un monstruo cuyo origen se
desconoce! Como científico, ¡no puedo
ignorarlo!""
""¡¿Tengo que recordarte la situación
financiera de Philanthropy?! ¡Ni siquiera
sabemos si podremos cubrir la renta de este
mes!"" dijo Mei Ling muy enfadada.
""Pero...""
""¡¿Y en vez de atraparlo, tú qué
sugieres?!""
""¡¿Vas a dejar que se nos escape esta
oportunidad de oro?! ¡Cobarde!""
""Pero, pero...""
Otacon y Mei Ling dijeron al unísono,
mientras yo todavía tenía mis dudas.
""¡Tenemos que hacerlo!""

cosa, ""De acuerdo.""

Creí a Olga. No parecía estar mintiendo, y
además, la existencia de ese ridículo
monstruo era suficiente prueba. Era
imposible que algo así viviera en nuestro
mundo, pero podía vivir en otro mundo.
Otacon lo explicó con una teoría sobre ""los
universos paralelos"".
|
Como de costumbre, la explicación de
Otacon fue interminable. Pero en resumen:
en vez de un solo universo, Otacon defiende
la idea de que existen una gran cantidad de
universos paralelos. Puede que un universo
sea exactamente igual que el mío, pero que
en él tenga un pelo menos. En otro
universo, la civilización ha podido surgir de
la paramecia. Incluso puede existir un
universo lleno de monstruos. Otacon cree
que estos universos deben de ser
mutuamente exclusivos, pero por alguna
razón han comenzado a mezclarse al azar.
Y así es como la Olga que nosotros
conocíamos se intercambió con la Olga de
un universo paralelo, y como el monstruo
apareció en nuestro universo. Otacon me
advirtió de que este fenómeno parecía ser
progresivo. Si su teoría era correcta, los
problemas eran graves y numerosos. |
Por ejemplo, es posible que dentro de una
hora, pueda intercambiarme con otra versión
de mí mismo proveniente de un universo
diferente. Era posible que Otacon ya
hubiera sido intercambiado por un Otacon
diferente. ¿Y qué nos ocurriría si nos
intercambiáramos con un universo en el que
la Luna estuviera a punto de colisionar con
la Tierra, por ejemplo? Era imposible
predecir lo que podría ocurrir. Por suerte, la
luna no se había chocado con nosotros...
todavía, o al menos no en nuestro universo.
Pero claro, eso no garantizaba que no fuera
a ocurrir mañana. 
|
""¿Cómo va el análisis del sistema de RV?""
Otacon movió la cabeza.
""Todavía no he conseguido nada...""
Cuando Olga dijo que el causante de todos
los problemas era el sistema de RV, Otacon
creyó morir. Me dijo que el motor
Koppelthorn, el corazón del nuevo sistema
de RV, era un aparato de informática
cuántica diseñado por el Doctor
Koppelthorn, pero desconocía su
fundamento. Abrió el caparazón, una caja
negra, y dentro no encontró más que unos
circuitos misteriosos, un montón de
engranajes y lo que parecían ser, esferas de
hierro. Pero aún así, funcionaba. Igual por
eso se había hablado tanto de este motor.
Aficionados a la ciencia pseudo habían
inspeccionado el motor, pero la única
conclusión a la que habían llegado era que
podía estar compuesto por piezas o
artefactos provenientes de Ovnis o de una
civilización perdida. En resumen, que nadie
sabía ni cómo ni porqué funcionaba. Y lo
que es más, nadie había visto nunca al
Doctor o Doctora Koppelthorn.
|
¿Cuál era entonces la conexión entre el
misterioso sistema de RV y la colisión de
los universos paralelos? Olga dijo que la
causa del problema era el sistema de RV,
ya que podía ""asomarse"" a otros universos.
Pero Mei Ling tenía su propia teoría. El
sistema de RV con el motor Koppelthorn no
sólo estaba construyendo una realidad
virtual a través de sus cálculos, si no que
además conseguía sortear el muro que
separaba los universos paralelos, llegando a
infiltrarse en realidades paralelas que
satisfacían ciertos requisitos, y luego
incorporaba esa información en el sistema
de cálculo de RV. Puede que eso estuviera
creando los disturbios en los universos
paralelos. Pero eso no era todo, dijo Mei
Ling. Puede que Olga estuviera buscando a
Gurlugon por ser la causa de la distorsión
entre los universos paralelos. Gurlugon se
había convertido en el fulcro sobre el que
giraba todo el espacio. Y si eso era verdad,
no se podría terminar con la distorsión sin
antes acabar con Gurlugon.
|
Y por esa razón, continuamos buscando a
Gurlugon. Perdimos el rastro del monstruo y
además no habíamos avanzado en el
análisis del sistema de RV. Pero
probablemente continuaban los disturbios
entre los universos paralelos. Igual incluso
había algún universo que estaba en peligro.
Y también era posible que nuestro universo
siguiera el mismo camino, muy pronto.
Teníamos los nervios a flor de piel.

De repente, Mei Ling dijo.
""Si matar a Gurlugon es la solución, todavía
podemos conseguirlo.""
""¿Qué quieres decir?""
Otacon levantó la cabeza y Mei Ling
empezó a explicar su teoría.
""Si es verdad que el sistema de RV puede
interferir con otros universos paralelos, ¿por
qué no intentamos matar a Gurlugon con el
sistema de RV? De esa forma estamos
matando realmente al Gurlugon original y el
Gurlugon en nuestro universo podría
desaparecer...""
""¿No es una medida muy extrema?"" objetó
Otacon. A lo que contestó Mei Ling:
""¿Y qué hacemos, sentarnos y observar la
foto? ¡Tenemos que hacer algo! ¿Estás de
acuerdo conmigo, no Snake?""
""No estoy seguro..."" contesté. Su lógica era
muy extrema. Pero al mismo tiempo, estaba
seguro que iba a terminar haciéndolo. La
solución no era hacer algo por hacer, pero

había ocurrido ninguna solución para el

singulares?""
""Probablemente. Pero se desconoce su
forma o situación en los universos paralelos.
No serán fácil de encontrar.""
""Tenemos información sobre Gurlugon. Si
analizamos sus pautas, y la relación que le
atrae a la RV, igual podemos...""
Otacon y Olga continuaron con su discusión
técnica. La conclusión, dijo Otacon, era
poner en práctica un método para encontrar
los elementos singulares de otros universos
paralelos ajustando, continuamente, el
parámetro de la función de la onda del
sistema de RV para imitar las pautas únicas
generadas por un elemento singular. En
otras palabras, tenía que participar en una
serie de ejercicios de RV. Las preparaciones
se terminaron antes de lo que yo esperaba.
Volví al asiento del sistema de RV. Otacon
dijo, ""En cuanto encuentre un elemento
singular, te lo comunicaré. Mientras tanto,
quiero que vayas superando niveles de RV.
Pero ten cuidado. No creo que Solidus se
quede de brazos cruzados. Puede que haya
trampas. ¡Manténte alerta!""
Otacon inició el sistema de RV. Ante mis
ojos se desplegó una Realidad Virtual.#C0

Estaba solo en la realidad virtual.
""Snake, puede que hayáis descubierto la
forma de encontrar elementos singulares
usando el sistema de RV. Pero no
encontraréis ninguno."" dijo de repente una

Llamé a Otacon.
""Otacon es Solidus.""
""Lo sé. Yo también le he detectado desde

de RV, pero todavía no tiene total control.
Vamos rápidamente al próximo escenario de
RV. ¿Estás listo?""

0xb3fbe,"Allí no había nada. Ni luz, ni ruido, ni frío, ni
calor, ni espacio. ¿Era esto el elemento
singular? Llamé a Otacon, pero fue Solidus
quien respondió. ""Estás en lo que se llama,
cómo puedo explicártelo para que lo
entiendas... el agujero entre los universos
paralelos.""
""¡¿Solidus!? ¡¿Qué estás intentando
hacer?! ¡¿Por qué estás intentando
destruir el universo?!"" grité.
""¿Destruir? No seas imbécil. Esto es una
corrección, para que las cosas sean como
eran...""
""¿¡Qué quieres decir?!""
""No sé quién creó el motor Koppelthorn, ni
cuándo ni dónde, o ni siquiera porqué. Pero
creo que fue diseñado como parte de un
sistema de red informática que se extiende
por los universos paralelos.""
Red informática. Había escuchado ese
término en boca de Otacon. Era una técnica
para crear una super red de ordenadores
que, conectando muchos servidores,
alcanzaría habilidades masivas de cómputo.
Si se pudiera construir uno que se
extendiera por todos los universos paralelos,
su potencia sería prácticamente ilimitada.
""Pero cuando el motor Koppelthorn fue
aplicado al sistema de RV, se convirtió en
un aparato para controlar la posibilidad en sí
misma,"" continuó Solidus.
""¿Controlar?""
""Eso es. Cuando al sistema de RV con el
motor Koppelthorn se le ordena que
construya un escenario de RV y se le
indican ciertas condiciones, lo que en
realidad hace es buscar entre los universos
paralelos aquellos que se ajusten a esas
condiciones. Y luego presenta esos
universos como el escenario RV. ¡Lo que tú
llamas entrenamiento de RV no es más que
la observación externa y la interrelación con
los universos paralelos!""
Me acordé de la extraña sensación que
tenía cuando estaba realizando un
entrenamiento de RV, como si poseyera el
cuerpo de otra persona. Supongo que esa
sensación era la interrelación con otro
universo. La voz de Solidus resonó:
""Durante los entrenamientos de RV, tus
acciones dentro de la realidad virtual se
reflejan en un grupo de universos. El
resultado de la interrelación actúa como
observación con respecto al grupo de,
todavía no definidos, universos paralelos, a
parte del universo con el que estás
interrelacionándote. Y eso quiere decir que
hay posibilidades de que el universo
converja con las mismas condiciones que
correspondan a tus acciones. Por ejemplo,
digamos que tú has matado a un soldado
enemigo en realidad virtual. Eso quiere decir
que el universo en el que habita ese
soldado ha sido observado y hecho
definitivo. En otras palabras, los universos
que tienen otras posibilidades a parte de
ésa, es decir los universos paralelos en los
que no has matado a ningún soldado,
pierden su potencial indefinido y
desaparecen de la existencia.""
Solidus continuó.
""El único universo que puede existir es
aquel que no contradiga las acciones que tú
llevas a cabo en la simulación de RV.
¿Sabes lo que eso significa? Cuando en el
sistema de RV se termina el juego y tú lo
intentas de nuevo, las posibilidades de
existencia de ese universo son nulas y será
por siempre eliminado. ¡Es decir, cada vez
que vuelves a jugar un gran número de
universos son destruidos!""
Estaba en estado de shock.
""Los alborotos que has visto en los
universos paralelos son en realidad la
distorsión creada por interferencias
externas. Supongo que lo podrías ver como
el grito de muerte de los universos que has
destruido. Los elementos singulares son una
forma concentrada de esa distorsión.""
Tuve un flashback, de Olga, Gurlugon y Mei
Ling. Si este alboroto estaba siendo
causado en realidad por interferencias
externas, entonces...
""¿Quiere eso decir que incluso nuestro
propio universo recibe interferencias del
sistema de RV de otros universos?""
""Por supuesto. ¿Nunca has sentido que tú
cuerpo no era en realidad tu cuerpo, y has
hecho algo inesperado tras notar esa
sensación? ¿O has conseguido hacer algo
de lo que no te creías capaz? Eso se debe
a las interferencias con otros universos.
Quizá la razón por la que pudiste derrotar a
Shadow Moses fue porque alguien, de otro
universo, te echó una mano."" La risa de
Solidus resonaba por todo el espacio.
""Durante mi investigación sobre los
universos paralelos, he descubierto que fui
asesinado varias veces en diferentes
mundos. Decidí protegerme. ¡Me negué a
reconocer cualquier universo en el que
hubiera muerto! Y por eso decidí
perfeccionar el sistema de RV. Interaccioné
con otros universos paralelos utilizando el
sistema de RV y los controlé para no morir
de nuevo. No me importa el daño que cause
al interferir con esos universos que no
reconozco y que por lo tanto son
eliminados. Lo único que me importa es mi
supervivencia. Y no hay nada más que

Cuando me levanté de la cama, la pantalla
de la televisión comenzó a hablar.
""Raiden, ¿nos recibes? Todavía estamos
aquí.""
""¡¿Los La-li-lu-le-lo?!""
Dijo Rose sorprendidísima. Los La-li-lu-le-lo
continuaron:
""Raiden. Quieres saber quiénes somos,
¿no?""
Salté de la cama. Los La-li-lu-le-lo habían
emitido algo parecido a una risa.
""¡Je, je, je! Como ya sabes, no somos
realmente... humanos. ¿Pero sabes qué?
Los retretes se manchan mucho, que si
orina seca, manchas amarillas, manchas de
agua... Hay que limpiarlos constantemente.
¿Estás de acuerdo?""
""¡¿Qué estáis diciendo?!""
Y justo entonces oí una voz que provenía
de la radio, aun estando ésta apagada.
""Raiden, ¿nos recibes? Todavía estamos
aquí.""
"" ¡Ta-ti-tu-te-to! ¡Jack! ¡Son los
Ta-ti-tu-te-to!"" gritó Rose.
Los Ta-ti-tu-te-to dijeron,
""Je, je, je. Tenemos un truco para limpiar
esas manchas amarillas. Primero, coloca
papel del baño sobre la mancha. Luego
echa el detergente. Déjalo reposar durante
unos minutos, y luego frota con fuerza...
con el papel.""
""¡¿Qué demonios...?!""
Y en cuanto dije esas palabras, el
contestador automático comenzó a hablar.
""Raiden, ¿nos recibes? Todavía estamos
aquí.""
""¡¿ I-ro-ha-ni-ho-he-to?! ¡Oh no Jack!
¡¿Qué podemos hacer?!""
Rose se agarró a mi brazo. La sujeté,
estaba temblando. Los I-ro-ha-ni-ho-he-to
dijeron,
""Y cuidado con el asiento del retrete.
A veces la orina se queda ahí.""
Los La-li-lu-le-lo dijeron.
""Ponéos guantes y usad una esponja o un
trapo para frotar los lugares a los que no
lleguéis con la escobilla.""
Los Ta-ti-tu-te-to continuaron.
""No sería una mala idea utilizar un cepillo
de dientes viejo.""
Y los I-ro-ha-ni-ho-he-to dijeron.
""Y no os olvidéis de limpiar bien por fuera
del retrete y el suelo, si dejáis alguna
mancha de orina, luego olerá mal.""
Grité una pregunta.
""¡¿Y eso qué tiene que ver con vuestra
identidad?!""
""¡¡¡NADA!!! Gritaron también los
La-li-lu-le-lo. Estaba desconcertado.
""¿Y entonces qué queréis decir?""
Contestaron todos al mismo tiempo.
""Je, je, je... Muy sencillo.""
Los La-li-lu-le-lo dijeron:
""Esta vez...""
Los Ta-ti-tu-te-to dijeron:

Los I-ro-ha-ni-ho-he-to dijeron:
